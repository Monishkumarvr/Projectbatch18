They are stunning! I have pretty sensitive ears. The weight nor the material irritate them. Will stay in place pretty well. Highly recommend.,1
"Amazing! Te color violet is gorgeous, and they're very comfy. Totally worth it!",1
"My earrings are beautiful! They are incredibly light, and exactly what I wanted. These are the most comfortable, adaptable, ear crawlers I have ever worn. 

I ordered these to wear to my sister's wedding. Unfortunately, shipping took a lot longer than the estimation I was given, and I did not receive them in time. (As I am located in the US, this is to be expected I'm sure.)",1
My daughter adores the beautiful earing and I enjoy the superb customer service! It is the second time I did a purchase in Kivotos and I can only highly recommend it! Many thanks again!,1
"I loved this ear crawler so much, I decided to get 2 to make it a set.",1
This was exactly what I wanted! This earring is even prettier in person. I paired it with a 'matching' stud for some asymmetrical flair.,1
These earrings are simply gorgeous and more than I could have hoped for. I definitely will be buying more from Miriam!,1
Perfect! Looks amazing on my giant earlobes and my daughter's nearly no lobes.,1
"A little tricky to get on, but once they're on they are magic! Lovely, carefully made, look great.",1
"These have been my favorite purchase on Etsy so far! They are absolutely stunning and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They look to be very high quality, not cheaply made. You will not be disappointed!",1

Love these! Wore them on my wedding. We're beautiful and unique. I got a lot of compliments!,1
So adorable! Got so many compliments on them!,1
"Bought these for my wedding and they are GORGEOUS. was a little confusing at first to figure out how to get them to stay up on my ear, but other than that they are so perfect. Super glad I bought these. They don't look or feel cheap and I love them",1
They are stunning I‚Äôm obsessed!,1
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!",1
"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!",1
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!",1
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.,1
"These are beautiful, quality, and hand crafted. I love them. They are stunning and unique. Very excited for my wedding day. My only recommendation for the shop owner is to post a photo of the back of the earring. I did not realize it had a stud and a clip on section (makes sense given its design; very practical!). I also like that I can adjust the strength of the clip on part. They are a bit heavier than you might expect, so if you have sensitive ears, you might want to go a bit smaller.",1
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.,1
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!,1
"Love these earrings! The are sleek and stylish, plus they look good with everything! I highly recommend.",1

Oh my goodness! These earrings/ear jackets are absolutely brilliant! Gorgeous!,1
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.,1
Absolutely love these gorgeous earrings - they are simply perfect. I chose pink and orange and the colour combination is beautiful. They are really different and I plan to order more. The packaging is also really cool! Delighted with this purchase and the seller was extremely helpful too - very happy!,1
Love them üß° ‚ú®,1
"My mom loves these shooting star earrings. Also, the package arrived quickly (from the UK) in spite of all the challenges folks are facing with these days - thank you so much and appreciate your effort!!",1
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.",1
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!,1
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù",1
Lena was amazing! I probably went through a dozen of diamond choices before I find the one that made my heart melt!! She was very patient and had me took all the time I need to decide. Thanks so much Lena!! I chose the setting of my dreams and they delivered the reality. Pricing is amazing and the quality is superb. I waited a few weeks to review to make sure im still in love with the ring. Well I am! very much everyday.  I plan to have this piece stay in the family forever. Thank you so much Lena! Let‚Äôs create more timeless pieces together ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

Perfectly beautiful!,1
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

"This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn‚Äôt hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!",1
"Thank you for fast shipping üëç

Unfortunately in my earcrawler one diamond was missing right away. 
As I live in Germany it doesnt make sense to ship it around the globe again to repair. 
So I brought it to a local jeweller to set in a new stone. 
The seller responded immediately, was cooperative and reimbused the costs of the repair. 

The ear crawler is very beautiful and a sparkling eyecatcher in a great size üåü 
For me this earcrawler represents a ‚Äöreal looking‚Äò shooting star that impressed me in a clear mountain night üòç",1

Thank you again! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Love these so much that I been wearing them ever since I've got them in the mail. It looks exactly like the photo. Size is perfect, length and the curve of the earring is perfect. The only issue it not like a regular earring, so its a little more looser and will fall but if you have a silicone earring backer, (which you can find a 1,000 piece on Amazon), it'll hold in place.",1
"I bought a pair, and am so glad that I indulged and got the real deal, they are stunning!  A beautiful shape, sparkly and clearly real gold and stones, I feel like a million bucks wearing these.  They're  weightless on my ears so I can leave them on day and night, and they look gorgeous with the trio stud I also bought.  Plus delivery was incredibly fast, two days from order to the UK!  I'll be back....",1
"Wonderful experience! I ordered on the 22 and received the earrings on the 24th! Super fast shipping! Beautiful earrings. I bought a pair. I‚Äôve had these in my cart for a while and finally purchased them. So glad I did. Super sparkly, unique and great quality. Thanks so much! :)",1

I love love love this earring!!!!! I want others now. I get so many compliments.,1

"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
My new fave earrings! My hair is really short its not easy to have statement stud earrings that aren't bulky or childish. Love these!,1
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.,1
"These are so great! I purchased a pair for my 20-year-old daughter and 17-year-old grand-daughter. They are NUTS over them. They are so adorable that I wish I'd gotten myself a pair! Gracy was so sweet, as well. I live in Michigan, so it took 3 weeks to arrive. Unfortunately, at Christmas, my package sat in US Customs for nearly 2 weeks!",1

"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think.",1
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :),1
"Exactly what I was looking for, not too heavy,  not too delicate.  Perfect length! Highly recommended!",1
"Love the necklace, highly recommended.  The chain is a lot shorter on me than on the model, so it would be nice t provide an option for longer chains.",1
This necklace is a real showstopper!  I can't wait to wear it for a night out on the town.,1
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!",1
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!",1
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent",1
Pinch a bit but it's to be expected! Love the look of them!,1
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª",1
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear",1
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D,1
"I absolutely love ear crawlers, but this is hands on the most elegant pair I‚Äôve ever bought. Outstanding quality and so delicate you‚Äôd almost forget you‚Äôre wearing them!",1
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!,1
"I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‚Äòback‚Äô, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they  originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received.",1
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)",1
The shop owner is AMAZING! Our package took a little longer than expected but she was willing to work with us. The earrings are  BEAUTIFUL!! Will buy it again.,1
"I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.",1
This piece is gorgeous!!! The picture does not do it justice. Great communication with the seller and it was packed so well for it's long journey to me. I will definitely buy another piece of jewelry in the future.,1
"I love this product it is beautiful!! I can‚Äôt wait to wear it to an upcoming wedding! The owner was very nice, I would definitely order from this shop again!",1
"Right from the start the communication was very clear. All of my needs and specifications were clearly understood. The end product was just amazing. The quality, the workmanship, the whole experience was just magical. Thank you so much for such a great and awesome experience!! The Blue and White Sapphire all round eternity band ring has made my mother really happy and she absolutely loves it!!!",1
"Wow! I recommend it to anyone; it is really a well done jewelry piece, it stays in place, it looks exactly as featured on the site, and I received a lot of compliments. Great for the summer!  Thank you üôè !",1
"These earrings took a while to get to me (I live in Canada) but 100% worth the wait! Unique, beautiful and well-made.",1
These are so unique! I‚Äôve gotten a ton of compliments on them. Adds a little bit more flair to a standard stud earring.,1
They we're everything I thought & more! Arrived when they were supposed to & were more beautiful than I thought they would be!! I would buy them again without any doubts!!,1
"Everyone LOVED this ear climber! I bought this silver ear climber for my fiance as her wedding day gift from me. And she looked stunning in this jewelry! It was the perfect item to compliment her look!

And working with Kaminer Design was a joy! She was completely on top of the shipping and business side of this transaction as well! I HIGHLY recommend!

"... and thanks a lot for this fantastic piece, it looks amazing and is very comfortable to wear! Whenever I wear this ear cuff people ask about it, it turns out to be quite the conversation piece!",1
"So beautifully crafted and wonderful conversation with the seller to make a small change to my piece. I love it and will be wearing it often. Thank you!! Broke the bank, but it was worth it lol",1
"And last but not least thank you so much for this great ear climber, too! I love the combination of this being a unique piece, still simple and elegant. This is another one I get lots of compliments for all the time!",1
Absolutely love this piece of jewelry! Very different and intricate: definitely my taste. This is probably my favorite piece of jewelry that I own!,1
"I got the silver ear crawler and I love it so much, it looks beautiful and it fits just right! Five stars for sure!",1
"Absolutely stunning! Wore these for my wedding, they were very comfortable, unique and beautiful.",1
So beautiful!!!! These are my first pair of climbers and will not be my last. They came in 4 days and I could not be happier!,1
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!",1
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop.",1
I get nothing but compliments with these amazing ear jackets!!!! Awesome :),1
"Earrings came about 1 week after placing order (5d to CA). They're very pretty and unique, I'll definitely order again from this shop. Came with 2 pairs of rubber backings- perfect because I promptly flung one of the backings into the nether regions of my bathroom upon trying them on. Fits perfect. The bars are large, if you want a daintier look maybe go with a different stud combo (ie the leaves with a smaller bar).",1
"I just adore everything about this cool ring. Awesome design, really beautiful tourmaline with so many shades of forest green. I love the vibes of this gorgeous ring... A million thanks to a very talented artist!",1
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!,1
"I am in love with these earrings! Fantastic quality! They aren‚Äôt too big or small, just the right size with a minimalist design. Thank you!",1
"I absolutely love her ear climbers! I got them in silver and rose gold and liked them so much I ordered a pair for my sister. So elegant, simple and different. Lots of compliments already :)",1
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another.",1
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!",1
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it.",1
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit.",1
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.,1
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"I am so delighted with these beautiful ear jackets! Love the delicate details and craftsmanship. The slice of wood that the earrings came packaged in was a creative, rustic touch. Already eyeing additional stud earrings to mix and match with the jackets - thank you!!",1
Love these little earrings! Have had many compliments on them.  Took a little while to get here from Lithuania but worth it!,1
"I love it so much, I might get another one for the other ear.  Great quality, very impressive in a quiet way!",1
Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them.

Thanks you I love them and I've got so many compliments on them :),1
I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!,1
This item took a while to get to me but I love it!! Totally worth the wait. The attention to detail in the earrings is amazing. They are gorgeous. I am extremely happy!!,1
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.,1
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup"".",1
"Lovely earrings. I bought two without even thinking I might get two for the same ear, as these are advertised singularly, but man is she good and sent me one for each ear!!!!  Just love them! Stunning statement without being gaudy üòç",1
"Shipped quicker than I thought! Only got the right silver one, but now I might have to get the left one too",1
"super cute and comfortable! they don't stay put when I try to wear them across my ear like the model (they stick out and down a little), so I just wear them vertically. I still love them, giving 4 instead of 5 stars because they didn't turn out to be what I thought they were going to... but still recommend!!!",1
"Wonderful! They fit securely, are very lightweight, and so amazingly unique! These were just what I was looking for! :)",1
"The item shipped really quickly! I love them, they're really detailed!",1
"Stunning detail, just an absolutely gorgeous piece!! Worth every penny, nickel, quarter and dime.",1
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!",1
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it.",1
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again.",1
"These earrings came quickly and were well packed. I like that they can be worn over the piercing (more like a cuff) or through it (although I've had a little trouble getting them in that way but that's user error!). They will be perfect for our Fall, outdoor engagement pics! Thanks again!",1
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!,1
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!",1
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!,1
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.,1
"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!",1
"Absolutely LOVE the cuff. It fits perfectly and stays in place. Customs were rediculously expensive though, but it's still a really beautiful ear accessory!",1
Very beautiful ear climber and matching stud. Fantastic quality. Would absolutely buy again.,1
Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).,1
"Beautiful item - absolutely thrilled with these! Packaging lovely, fabulous seller, quick delivery - perfect all round. So pleased!!",1
"My favourite kind of earrings from now on, they're so delicate but look lovely!",1
Lovely items and beautifully packaged. Thank you.,1
These earrings are gorgeous. I love that they are mismatched. They are delicate and beautifully made. I always get complements on them.,1
"I was waiting impatiently for it and finally received this morning. 
Delicate design, girly but discreet, in a very nice packaging and with detailed maintenance advices. 
Now impatiently waiting to show off :)",1
The quality is exactly as I expected. The shipping was slower than expected but I assume is covid related and the seller was always available and kept me inside what was happening shipping wise. I already use this ring for a couple weeks and my anxiety ticks diminished.,1
"The cottagecore shawl pin and flower+stem earrings are absolutely gorgeous! The quality is excellent and the products look exactly as promised.

I am absolutely going to purchase more items from ninibrooch as soon as I am able because the designs are truly stunning.",1
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!",1
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx",1
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader.",1
I am OBSESSED with these!! They are beautiful. The ear jacket is only slightly curved so if you have a very round earlobe like me it won't fit perfectly flush under there but I think it still looks good. Shipping was fast. Thank you!!,1
"These earrings shipped so fast, arrived in the sweetest packaging with a handwritten thank you note, and are just AWESOME. Exactly as pictured. If you're concerned about the drop length of the earring and if it will fit your earlobe, don't worry- they are adjustable! Great purchase, great shop- will be back for more!",1
"The owner is fantastic. The item was out of stock, I messaged her about it and she gave a quick reply as to availability along with regular updates about when she would have new stock ready to ship. Really nice and courteous. 

I have to say my greatest concern going in was that the earring would not be as described/pictured. Now that I've received them I am really impressed. Definitely sterling silver 925. And very dainty and subtle. Really beautiful work by owner, and okay delivery time considering I live in Sydney, Australia. 

Have been getting so many compliments, will definitely shop here again. 

Thank you so much.",1
My ear jackets are beautiful and arrived more quickly than I expected. I also like that I can wear the studs alone and mix and match the ear jackets with other earrings I already own. They're a perfect addition to my jewelry box.,1
They look exactly the way I wanted them to. I'm really happy!,1
Beautiful earrings! Shipping was on time and I had no issues!,1
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!",1
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more",1
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.,1
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!",1
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)",1
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)",1
"This was my second purchase of these earnings as when my daughter saw them she wanted some! They arrived promptly and were beautifully wrapped in recycled material. They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings). I love them!",1
Love them!,1
"Love, love these earrings! They came in a simple and elegant box and tissue, ready as Christmas presents. They arrived on time with no problems. The earrings are beautifully created, simple and elegant in design. The amethyst gives them a colorful touch. Beautiful work. Thank you!",1
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!
Sincerely Yours,

Catharina Hassid",1
"Good quality earrings, very elegant and arrived in good time. My only criticism is the presentation - they came just in a card sleeve.. So now I have to find a nice box to present them in. Apart from that, very happy. Thanks",1
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!",1
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!",1
Very cute and unique!,1
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response.",1
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!,1
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too.",1
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!,1
"International shipping a little delayed because of COVID-19 and the holidays but WORTH THE WAIT!

I can't believe how fine and delicate these are. They glisten and these look and feel handcrafted with love. Highly recommend!",1
So cute! Love it exactly what I wanted,1
The birthday girl was very pleased. Reminding her of a past trip there and anticipating a return trip some day.,1
"The ring came quickly, but after not even 2 weeks the gold has tarnished off and it turned my finger green.",1
"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish.",1
"I looooove those earclimbers, they are so beautiful üòç",1
"Everything about this transaction was AWESOME! First, the earrings themselves are beautiful and are exactly as expected.

I also cannot believe how quickly the package got to me in the United States from Greece.

And while I bought these for myself, the packaging would have made for such a cool gift. 

I will definitely purchase from Vasilia again, and I recommend you do, too. You won't be disappointed!",1
These earrings are beautiful! They look amazing! The overseas shipping was really fast too. Thank you.,1
Super cute! It took kind of a long time to get here but it was worth the wait!,1
Really beautiful!!!,1
I LOVE these earrings!!! They‚Äôre so cute and go with a variety of outfits/styles.,1
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!",1
So pretty! It is more dainty in person than what I was imagining from the picture but I was pleasantly surprised!  I am planning on wearing it at my wedding and it will match well with my  other jewelry. Thank you!,1
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.,1
"Came beautifully packaged, and looks amazing in my helix.",1
"I was so pleasantly surprised when I received these because they were more detailed and beautiful in person than what I saw on the picture. Unfortunately for me they didn‚Äôt fit my ears right, I have small ears so I‚Äôm not surprised, and when it reached out to the seller to ask for a return the customer service was phenomenal and the process was super easy. Even though this pair of earrings didn‚Äôt work out for me I will be looking for another pair through this seller",1
"it fits well, especially the cuff. its snug but doesn't hurt, plus it's pretty!",1
This mismatched pair of butterfly earrings is divine. They shipped and arrived quickly. Thank you!!!,1
"Gorgeous earrings! A little tight, but easy to pull looser.",1
"Absolutely beautiful!!! Stunning craftsmanship. So happy with these earrings. Once my package shipped, it got here crazy fast! Jess was great to work with and I am completely happy with my purchases :) Thanks Jess!!",1
"I was so excited to get these and they did not disappoint! I love how they look, they are comfortable, and easy directions for putting on were provided. My earlobes are only single pierced so this is a great option to add a little extra sparkle üíñ",1
This photo doesn't begin to do this item justice! These earrings are so beautiful! The quality is amazing! From the minute you open the box you are intoxicated and can't stop looking at them!  Worth every penny! Now I wish I would have gotten the cuff as well! I love üíò these so much!!!,1
"absolutely perfect, I‚Äôm in love!",1
omg I am speechless. it is so beautiful ! I love it ! thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
Beautiful,1
"Extravagante, wundersch√∂ne Ohrkletterer! Bequem zu tragen. Ich bin begeistert!",1
Beautiful and elegant. You can tell they are made by an interesting boutique xx,1
Adorable earrings in adorable packaging! They arrived quickly and are lovely; my only quibble is that the tiny ear climbers are a little too tiny for my plump earlobes. I flared them out and put them in my second holes and I think they're going to work!,1
"Love it! My ears are super sensitive, and it only took about 3-4 days for my ear to adjust. It's minimal and totally work appropriate for a conservative work environment. Bonus: I'm super lazy and have no problems sleeping in it!",1
These earrings were so cute! Very nicely made! Fit my ears perfectly! Thanks so much :),1
"I really like these earrings. It took quite awhile for them to ship, but I am able to overlook that since they are so versatile and cute!",1
"So comfortable and its perfect size!!! So pretty, too!",1
These are beautiful!  The seller was amazing and happy to make custom alterations.  Wow.,1
Pictures gave excellent idea of how it would look in ear. Easy to put on and all day comfortable. Love how it looks.,1
Unique.,1
Absolutely in love with my ear climbers! I have super sensitive earlobes so the hypoallergenic aspect was huge for me. I've worn them all day without any issues. Perfect size and color. Very sturdy. I love the velvet box it came in! Will definitely order from this store again. üòä,1
Wore this for Halloween as part of my 1920's flapper costume. Loved it! Very well made and authentic looking. Comfy too :),1
I love them üòç,1
These earrings were exactly what I wanted in a climber - very delicate & fit well.  They show above my mask!,1
I love my new twig climber earringsüëèüèªü•∞üëèüèª‚ù§Ô∏èI‚Äôve been wearing them everyday since I got them! They‚Äôre especially easy to wear with the masks I have to wear at work! I highly recommend them! Super high quality and beautifully detailed! I feel like an elf and I love it!!üòçthanks SO much!! I‚Äôll be back soon!,1
"I'm in love with these climbers! I thought they might be tricky to get in or that they wouldn't stay in place, but they're designed so well, that there were no issues. They're so detailed and delicate! Such unique pieces of jewellery!",1
"Really lovely, handcrafted pieces.  The plant-themed pieces are gorgeous (and accurate!).  These are well-made climbers that seem like they will hold up for years and years, but still have a delicate look.  Will definitely purchase from this shop again.  Thanks for the beautiful blueberry twigs, Lucie!",1
Love love love these earrings. The size of these earrings are perfect! Both my mom and grandma want a pair after seeing mine. They are the only earrings I wear now. They bring me so much confidence and they're just too cute!!!,1
"Love it! It's a little bit loose and gets facing weird directions but of course it does. It's gorgeous, exactly what I wanted!",1
Beautiful piece. Thank you so much.,1
"These earrings are AMAZING! they are my go to, and are often worn daily. Great quality and great design. I have them in both finishes <3",1
Love Love Love my necklace!!! Thank you so much. It turned out exactly as I wanted and 100% true to picture. Now for some matching earrings ;-),1
"This was my second time buying from MINKARA. The shipping was free and I Got the ring really quick! It was beautifully wrapped for no extra cost, and it's made with really good craftsmanship. I was not sure of the right size but Teresa guided me through it and I could download a free ring sizer PDF from her website, which helped a lot. My girlfriend absolutely loved it!! 
I'll definitely buy from this shop again :-)",1
"GORGEOUS! I can't say enough good things about these ear crawlers. I bought them to wear in my second piercing hole along with a pair of gorgeous raw pearl drop earrings that match these to a tee. Shipping was quick, and they were delivered in the cutest package.",1
I love these so much!! So beautiful and well made. I get so many compliments whenever I wear them. Excellent customer service too üòäThank you so much!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ú®,1
"Tiffany is amazing- communicative, helpful and even made me a smaller earring to accommodate my tiny ears hahaha. The earrings are so beautiful and I get tons of compliments on them! Thank you Tiffany!! üíé",1
I would totally recommend this shop and seller! The sellers (Tiffany and Micah) are two of the nicest sellers on etsy and very attentive to my order! I bought my earrings during the holidays and it was shipped fast and it arrived even faster. The moonstone earrings are beautiful and very well-made. They are delicate and feminine yet very sturdy. The stones and metal are of the best quality.,1
Absolutely stunning ear climbers! I will say it's not super mask compatible. It accidentally fell off when I went to take my mask off and if I hadn't paid attention I would have lost it. If you aren't clumsy like me that might not be a problem! :),1
"The Earrings are Stunning & the Moon Phase is fabulous. 
VillaSorgenfrei was attentive & it shipped on time. 
Thanks so much !",1
"5 stars üåü for my Moon üåô phase silver earrings ‚ú®üôè!! I love them !! I love the Moon üåôüíõ!!! These earrings capture all the phases of the Moon üåô. Thank you for shipping, packaging and delivered on time üëçüèªüòâ!! They arrived safely after a long journey to the UNITED STATES üá∫üá∏!!!  Thank you. Constance from Iowa ‚òÆÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è.",1
"These are beautiful! They were a Christmas gift for myself. I do wish the wire fit a little tighter to my ear; because my earlobes are thin, they tend to drop instead of climb. But even then, I still love the way they look!",1
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)",1
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x",1
Beautiful earrings. Make me feel like a star and great colours!,1
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!,1
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)",1
"Climbers are so beautiful! They arrived in a cute little corked jar where they live when I'm not wearing them. The stem piece that will thread through the hole is a little thicker than most earrings, but they went in fine. Love em!",1
Absolutely perfect! So in love with these ear climbers!,1
literally so freaking cuteeeee! i get so many compliments on them,1
Albina makes such beautiful pieces- I absolutely love my ear cuffs and ear climber. She was so kind in her customer service as I needed to exchange sizes and she was so helpful and quick in shipping the right sizes out and letting me do so! I will definitely be ordering more pieces from her in the future. If I could give her a 100 star rating I would! Just lovely all around!,1
This is my second time ordering these! (because I lose everything)  Just as beautiful as the first order! So cute and different and easy peasy. Love this shop,1
"Beautiful, so unique! Exactly what I expected. They are so comfortable to wear, I forget they‚Äôre even there. And the two little cuffs just add a little something extra. So happy with these!",1
"I bought both the gold and silver in these earrings. They are absolutely gorgeous and light bounces off them beautifully. They are light and delicate but create an intriguing impact. The gold set with the 2 cuffs are a beautiful look together - lots of compliments every time I've worn them. They are the kind of earrings were they catch someone's eye and they want to look closer because of the way the metal sits up into the crease of the ear. Fantastic new way of wearing ear jewelry without it being loud, huge, garish or 'try hard'.
Thankyou for making something so beautiful.",1
"I‚Äòm in love with these earringsüòçThey are so adorable. And I‚Äòm really happy that they have 2 holes, so I can choose the length of the pendants and so they fit nicely on the earlobe.",1
These are really cool and unique! I love the earring jacket look! It is like having the impact of several piercings in one piece! Again with this style I could use an additional option for shortening the earrings tighter to my lobes. This is probably my own problem because my first piercings are so stretched out from little kids yanking on them in my youth! Very cool though!,1
I love these earrings so much! So cute and dainty but still makes a statemetnt and the quality is great for the price! Will be buying more!,1
Love these earrings so much bought 2 pairs. Top quality. Perfect overseas shipping. My new favorite for earrings. Thanks so very much.,1
I think these earrings are fantastic! They are just what I was looking for. Light weight and beautiful!,1
"The climbers were a little larger than I expected (or I just have small earlobes) but they're well-made and the climber ""stalk"" has enough space that my earlobes sit comfortably while the climbers are stable in place. They look lovely and they were quickly dispatched. Thanks!",1
"I love my new earring, thank you very much! Shipping to Germany went extremely quickly! I am very happy!",1
Just perfect. I wear them everyday and I get so many compliments on them. Thank you for such beautiful craftsmanship ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!,1
"Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!!  I get compliments constantly.  I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else.  These are perfect!  I have them in 24/7 and have no issues.  Will definitely be purchasing more!",1
Love the material and design of this item!  I've also gotten many compliments on its unique design - it looks and feels high-quality. One thing I wasn't expecting was the thick gauge of the earring. It hurt my ear slightly and it'll take time for my ear to stretch out.,1
"Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship. Thank you for providing titanium ear climbers, they're really hard to find. I'll be back for more!",1
"Love love, gorgeous. He makes it easy to customize the earring. Shipping was quick easy to track. Couldn't be happier.",1
I can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about these earrings. They‚Äôre perfectly simple yet incredibly elegant. I ordered them to wear on my wedding day and I got so many compliments on them. They look stunning in pictures as they have such a high-end and contemporary design. The only downside to my earrings were that they were actually stolen on my wedding night - so clearly I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks they‚Äôre gorgeous! I definitely recommend these earrings and the seller! I look forward to replacing my earrings once the wedding and our move is paid off - they‚Äôre definitely earring I think you can dress up or down. They‚Äôre the perfect pair of versatile earrings.,1
I am in love with these earrings!  Beautiful made and look great.  They are so me!  Fast shipping from Israel and packed lovely.  Thank you!,1
I really love these earrings. Couldn't imagine that somethi g could be that beautiful but these ones do. They are so unique. I can really recommend to buy them.,1
"Wow, these ear climbers are so beautiful in person! They're elegant and better than I expected. They're also incredibly light so you don't notice you're wearing them. You can sleep in them, shower in them, etc., and they stay securely in place. Also, the shipping was super fast. Thank you!",1
These are beautiful earring climbers!!! I wanted a simple silver look and these are PERFECT,1
"I don't wear earrings a lot.  Due to my job requiring me to be on the phone almost 80% of my day, they are uncomfortable.  But these, are exactly what I needed!  I've gotten a lot of compliments on them!",1
Fast shipping & the quality is excellent!! I was able to adjust the ear climber easily & it feels very secure. Love the way they look‚Äîjust like the photo.,1
"Earrings are absolutely beautiful and Inali was so incredibly sweet and accommodating when the US postal serviced seemed to misplace my package. She runs a fantastic shop and I highly recommend supporting her work. Thanks again, Inali! xx much love.",1
IN LOVE! These are so flipping cute and I get so many compliments!,1
Loved these earrings!,1
Lovely simple design.. Will wear often. Long time to ship and slight imperfections in silver coating.. but overall very nice. Thanks!,1
"These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)",1
"These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!",1
Love these! First time trying this style and I‚Äôm addicted. These are simple and elegant.,1
Love these!!! Wear them for a statement stud and also plan to pair it with a pearl stud for my wedding. :) thank you so much,1
Gorgeous!!!! The pictures did them justice and they're perfect for my wedding!!,1
I was very pleased with how it looks I love them         They came in record time I would definitely recommend them to anyone,1
These were beautiful and look real - were beautiful to wear on my wedding day!,1
So cute!! Got a lot of compliments! Easy to put in too and great quality!!,1
"Beautiful piece of jewelry, shipped quickly! And the seller customized the size for me. Definitely recommend!!",1
Absolutely love these earrings!! They're exactly what I was looking for. They're beautiful and super comfy!,1
"Love these earrings! Beautiful! Great communication, lost an earring and they made a special order for me to replace earring. Def would buy from again!!",1
I love this set.  It is very small but exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!!,1
Love these! Thank you for the upgrade to a better material! I will probably be a repeat customer in the near future :),1
"The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It‚Äôs maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It‚Äôs kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger.",1
The earrings are fabulous! Greatly appreciate their simplicity & minimalistic nature.  Thank you!!! <33,1
"Delicate and beautifully hand made, these were shipped quickly and securely! Maybe it is just my curved earlobes, but the triangle ear jackets weigh next to nothing so they may not hang straight downwards. Your ears may differ. Thank-you for the earrings.",1
"These are my new favorite pair of earrings! They seriously go with everything. They were packaged securely and arrived in as timely a manner as I could have hoped, given that they came from another continent. I don't buy much jewelry, but I can definitely see myself buying more pieces from airlab!",1
"The earrings are beautiful and unique - I get so many questions and compliments about them, I am definitely purchasing from AIRlab again.",1
I absolutely love my new earrings! Dainty and adorable. I get lots of compliments on them. They shipped very quickly and I couldn't be happier! Thank you very much!!!,1
They're the best earrings I've ever worn. I don't even know how you could do such a perfect handmade work! Stunning!!,1
Bought these ear jacket earrings with the lotus studs. They are even more beautiful than the pictures show. Love them!,1
"These are even MORE beautiful in person! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!!!! I can't believe how pretty they are, even in their own simplicity! Thank you so much!",1
"I love these earrings!  They're super versatile and can be worn dressy or casual. I also love that I can just wear the main bar only if I want, so it's like getting two pairs in one.",1
"These are so nice on.  First time wearing ear jackets and they were a bit fiddly to get on but practice makes it easier.  Really understated, modern look.  Love them!",1
I love these earrings and have had so many compliments on them.  They are different and fun.  Shipping was great.,1
"My ear climbers are elegant and a bit sassy. I get lots of compliments. The short climbers are a perfect size for my small ears and are very comfortable to wear. I love them!
The international delivery and correspondence was very quick. I'm already trying to work out my next Glamrocks Designs purchase - thank you!",1
I love them!!! Super cute!! And lots of compliments.,1
"I love them! Simple and unique, which is exactly what I wanted. Very fast shipping- just perfect!",1
These are beautiful! Shipping was very fast and packaging was perfect.,1
Beautiful and dainty! I love these!,1
So adorable. Love my ear ring crawler,1
Beautiful earrings! Only complaint is that it frequently gets caught on my hair because of the long back,1
"I really like these earrings. I always wear this long style and these are super cute. If you want to give them as a gift, the box they come in is super cute and fancy looking. The shipping was very fast, I ordered these earrings the same day as another pair of earrings from another Etsy store, and they arrived today whereas the other store only shipped theirs today. Id 100% recommend this seller.",1
Absolutely beautifully packaged and the amethyst leaf is gorgeous! Will purchase again !,1
"These beautiful amethyst leafy earrings were exactly what I was looking for. They are completely unique from a basic stud. And they are personalized to my birthstone, which makes it even more special!! Great work and shipping was fast! 
Will be ordering more !",1
"Truly beautiful piece of jewelery! I was so surprised at how shiny and sparkly this was when I opened up the box. My original plan was to wear 1 snake earcuff then another simple stud on the other ear, the snake was so pretty that I immediately ordered a second 1 in silver to match the gold one. I can't wait till it gets here. I also bought a pair of the leaves studded earrings. I love them as well.",1
"These earrings are truly beautiful! I ordered them for my wedding day, crystal and rose gold finish! Can‚Äôt say enough, truly perfect for my big day!",1
What an amazing purchase! This climber earring is absolutely stunning. It is so much more beautiful in real life. It is such a bonus that a matching stud is also supplied for the other ear. Highly recommend!,1
AMAZING earrings!!! Purchased for my wedding and cannot wait to wear them. I had to contact customer service because I messed up my order and Tommy was SUPER helpful and great to work with. Highly recommend this shop!!,1
Amazing customized earrings! Fantastic quality! Very comfortable for such a large crawler and stays in place!,1
I really like this necklace it's very dainty and I love how it doesn't come with adjustable length options - because it doesn't get caught up with my other necklace. It's the right amount of sparkle too.,1
I just got them. Wow. They are so pretty. I will definitely come here to buy more! Thank you!,1
This chain is absolutely perfect. The shine and the reflection it give off when it hits the light is the best. Looks beautiful with my CC charm. Thank you.,1
"It‚Äôs so beautiful, I love it. It really gleams like real gold. You can definitely see the quality in the way it sparkles. I got the thinnest chain and it still shines very bright. Thank you so much.",1
"I LOVE these ear jackets!  As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since!  They are very well made, and I just love the look.  I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper).  They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured.  Either way is great - don't hesitate!  Virginia, thanks for making these for me!",1
"Beautiful handmade earrings. My earlobes are kind of small so the ball spheres hang down a little lower than shown in the picture, but they are really cool anyway. The seller kept in touch with me about shipping when the wait was a little longer than expected. Thanks!",1
"I have always hated jacket earrings...until I saw these!!!  So cute, such simple design, clever, and modern.  I love them!!",1
Fab!,1
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan.",1

"These earrings are very beautiful, one of my favorites now! :)",1
Very pretty I love them!,1
Very cute and very comfortable!,1
Very pretty.  My daughter loved them.,1
Very cute and unique earrings!,1
"I bought these as a treat for myself.  I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have.  These were just right!  Shiny and not too big.  The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D  The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point.  All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again!  The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too.",1
Amazin necklace!! you won't regret,1
It is absolutely beautiful!! Exactly what I was hoping for-thank you so much!!,1
Loved the look online. Just think it's over priced for the quality of product that arrived. My backing fell off before I could even get to wear the earrings.,1
The seller was extremely pleasant and easy to work with. They answered all my questions. I was confused by the shipping but it came at a good time. Thanks!,1
I love those earrings! They fit perfectly and they look so great!,1
My secret santa loved them. Thanks so much!,1

"This is second pair I have bought, first were a gift,  this pair for me. Beautiful earrings.",1
Very happy with my earrings. Looks exactly like picture and postage was super quick!,1
I love these! They are so cute. Substantial feeling too- like they won‚Äôt break ever. I also love the length up my ear :) I‚Äôm so happy! Thank you! I‚Äôll be back for more!!!!,1
Beautiful! I am in love with these! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"I love these earrings,  they are just gorgeous! They are well-made and the gems sparkle and shine. Thanks for shipping quickly.  I will be enjoying these for many years to come!",1
"I love these ear climbers! I have little ears and have the hardest time finding ones that stay on and FINALLY, these stay on perfectly!!!",1
Love these earrings! They are the perfect size. Also shipping  was incredibly quick!,1
"Love the earrings, great quality too. Can‚Äôt wait to buy more from this shop!",1
"Love this ear crawler and all my pieces from Vintage Acorn. Well crafted, friendly seller and was able to pick up at my convenience!",1
"My earring arrived very quickly, love the earring and the cute little box it came in.
Thank you",1
"Was just what I wanted.
Very delicate.
I am receiving so many compliments!!",1
"I love my new ear climbers!  They came in a lovely little package, tied with a bow!  They are beautifully made!",1
"Beautiful craftsmanship, they look just like the photos! I'm finding it a bit uncomfortable to put them in my ears, but I guess that probably just takes some practice (this is my first pair of ear climbers). They were carefully packaged and shipped quite fast. All in all, I would buy from this seller again. :)",1
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! Took me a bit to get them in place the first time and adjusted to my ears but now they sit comfortably and are a breeze to put in. I would highly recommend them!,1
Very cool!!  I wish my ears were still pierced as I would have kept them for myself!!  Thank You,1
"Beautifully crafted. Shipping was fast and well packaged.
Thanks for great work and lovely ear sweeps.",1
Lots of compliments!  Great product!,1
Smooth transaction. Love them so much.,1
"Such unique pieces! It was so hard to choose, they‚Äôre all so cute but I am so happy and pleased with my septum, and my nostril hoop! I also got a L shaped stud, but can‚Äôt change it yet but am so excited! It shipped in a cute little wooden box as well ü•∞ love all of my pieces SO much!!",1
"this nose ring is awesome!! it has a double look, one with the gemstones and I love the way it hooks under my nostril making it look like a hoop. Easy to put in and it feels very comfortable. I get lots of compliments! Plus the artist lives in the Ukraine. Glad to help a sista out!",1
"This is my new favorite septum ring. The 8mm 16g fits snugly, but comfortably, under my nose. It was tricky for me to get in at first, since the hinge goes from right to left while putting it in... but I have others like that and am getting used to it. 

I love how customizable this shop's rings are. The gold with red stones really pops.

The seller treated me very well,  responding quickly and courteously to my questions. I appreciate the personal touches to Etsy transactions. Thank you for this gorgeous jewelry and friendly experience!",1
Die Ear Crawler sind total Klasse und super schnelle Lieferung. Werde auf jeden Fall wieder vorbei schaun.,1
"Perfect earrings, well made, good quality. The only point is excessive packaging, I would prefer to receive all buckets and letters electronically.",1
I absolutely love my ear crawlers they are adorable and stay put unlike most where you have to keep adjusting and tightening! I‚Äôve received so many compliments! I can‚Äôt wait to get more! I love these earrings so much I would love to help the owner advertise! üòò,1

Absolutely gorgeous earrings - they look high quality and I‚Äôm eager to give them as a gift! (Might buy some for myself later too) Shipping was super speedy as well,1
Super cute and high quality!! I have gotten many compliments on them :) Great for people who have only pierced their ears once and don‚Äôt have 2nd holes,1
"The items are beautiful, nicely handcrafted with a lovely and delicate design. They fit elegantly on the ears. The seller is an absolute star: the parcel got lost on the way and the seller simply resend the goods via courrier at no extra cost. Thank you so much!",1
Love this piece. Beautifully designed and fits my ear perfectly.,1
Beautiful earrings and well made. Shipping was exceptionally fast considering the epidemic and that they arrived from Europe. I am very happy with them!,1

I bought the rose cold constellation earrings as a birthday gift for my sister and she absolutely loved them. Sophia also answered all of my questions promptly and was very accommodating. I also received the earring sooner than expected. Very happy with my purchase :),1
BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments.  The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!,1
I wore these as MOH at my friend's wedding. Absolutely loved them!,1
"I absolutely love this earrings!!! The crystals are sparkling so beautifuly and they're really stylish. They're exactly as I wanted them to be, can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! It's a really special final touch on my outfit for That Day... THANK YOU A LOT!! <3 <3 <3",1
"Absolutely stunning earings!!! My only complaint: while the clamp style backing on the top of the earing is great for keeping it in place, it is slightly uncomfortable. That said, I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again.",1
"I absolutely LOVE this item! I've been looking for a more fun item for my cartilage piercing and j have finally found it. Great material. Very awesome artist too- I goofed and ordered the left earring when I needed the right, and she was so open to the exchange and it was super easy. Thanks Melanie!!",1
"I love it!...might want to pierce the left just to wear another one of these. Just a suggestion, maybe a shorter post with a smoother/screw clasp...but still love what I got!",1
The package is wonderful and thoughtful. This cartilage earring is by far the best earring i bought. It is not heavy and it looks good. Thank you,1
In love with this new piece! Even better in person!! Thank you!,1
"VERY beautiful, just as pictured. Sparkles like no other.  I'd 100% order from this shop again in the future.",1
"Previous ratings were right, even more stunning in person.  Lovely stones, lovely craftsmanship.",1
I have come to admire this very different style of earring.  Quite stunning in person. I purchased to coordinate with the equally gorgeous Sapphire Blue bracelet in this order.  High quality creation.,1
"wow! all I can say is these are wonderfull. I tried them on and my twin sister went screaming to her computer to see what else you guys have. love,love love them",1
I wore these beautiful earrings for my wedding and they were perfect. She made sure I had them in time and I received  so many compliments.  I love that I will definitely wear them over and over too. Can be dressed up or dressed down!,1
These are even more beautiful in person. I got two pairs. One yellow gold (left) and one white gold (right). Both hammered. The hammered effect makes the light hit them at different angles and gives them a little sparkle. They can be dressed up or down. The shop owner is amazing and communication is fantastic! Highly recommend!,1
"Beautiful ear climber, looks stunning! I'm really happy with it, thank you!",1
"Really LOVE it! Sits perfectly, very light and elegant, fits to any look and highlights the ear beautifully. Delivery was quick and painless, everything is perfect. 

Thank you, Claire, I will be back:)",1
Love these!  Not gaudy and adds interest to studs. Light and move beautifully,1
"Amazing packaging, very creative and eco friendly.  These jackets are great for wearing with any studs, haven't tried them slipped onto climbers yet but I can see them being amazing for that as well.  Very tempted to get the longer pair as well.",1
I really like these. I would be interested in similar items with more/longer strands.,1
Bought these for my daughter and she's thrilled with them. I have to admit they do look good and will add variety to her ordinary studs. Thanks Tanglemoss.,1
Amazing! Perfect for my geology/petroleum engineering major! She loves them. Arrived from Maylasia 2 days after shipping. Couldn't believe it,1
Love love love love love!!!!,1
"These earring are absolutely PERFECT , I‚Äôve had other climbers that constantly fall off the ear but these stay right where you put them- so beautiful and exactly what I was expecting! Highly recommend this shop- I will be buying more from here! (Also received a promo code simply for shopping for my next purchase)",1
"I get so many compliments!  I love
These!",1
"I love these earings. They are really well made, everything was on time and i will definetly buy more beautiful items from this shop. Sharing love and pretty things. Thank you!",1
Love the delicacy of this climber.  My daughter wanted ear cuff climbers for Christmas; her look of delight when she realized these were waves told me we made the perfect selection.,1
"I love these earrings!!!!  At first they didn't stay in a climbing position but that's because I got the 7 stone climbers and my upper ears are both thin and narrow. I have issues with all climbers because of my ears. I worked with the store and she was amazing to work with. Margay walked me through how to adjust them and they work!!! They stay in a climbing position! I love these earrings, great quality, super great customer service and fast shipping. Will be purchasing from this shop again for certain.",1
"This shop is AMAZING!! The original climbers were about 2 stones too big, and they offered to make me a new set with 2 less stones. And now they are PERFECT!! I will definitely buy more items from this shop because they obviously care about the happiness of their customers. Thank you so much for being so awesome!!!!!",1
"Completely obsessed! I've received so many compliments and I can barely feel them in my ear. I typically can't wear earrings for more than a few hours, but I've worn these all day and absolutely love them!",1
I am obsessed with these!! Thank you SO much! üí´üí´üí´,1
"I love Lucie‚Äôs jewelry!! I now have two of her items that I‚Äôve been coveting (elk antler ear climbers and cedar ring) and both were shipped out sooner than expected and arrived perfectly. The quality of her jewelry is well above what I had expected, and every piece is so delicate and beautifully detailed. I will definitely be treating myself to more of her pieces in the future! Thank you Lucie!",1
Amazing! I love these. I was searching for the perfect pair of ear climbers and I found them!!! I wanted something interesting but not blingy. These are beautiful and classy with a bit of edgy. Great quality!,1
"I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me.  I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did.  I love them (I ordered the pair).  They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!",1
"Totally love this piece! It is beautiful, it holds in place, it is comfortable and I've gotten several compliments. It shipped really quickly.",1
Wore these earrings on my wedding day and they were perfect. So beautiful.  This is  my 2nd pair. I unfortunately lost the 1st pair and I wanted to wear them for a wedding I was a bridesmaid in. I got a lot of compliments on the earrings!,1
"I ordered these crawlers for my wedding. They arrived on time but they were the wrong color. I reached out to the seller and she sent me a new pair with expedited shipping so they arrived in time for the wedding and reimbursed me for the return shipping for the others. I am very pleased with the earrings, they are super pretty and I will wear them many times after my wedding!",1
"They are so beautiful!! I haven't tried them on yet, but am so excited :)
Update: I wore them for the first time today, I love them!!! I was pleasantly surprised by how well they stayed on, no falling or anything!",1
"These earrings are beautiful!!! At first I was confused how to put these on but the creator was so sweet about explaining how they slide on differently than other pierced earrings... I have a short gray pixie cut and they bring just the right sparkle to catch the eye... thank, thank!!!!!",1
"Read the instructions or your earrings will not be secure! Once you do, your earrings aren't going anywhere! I'm so grateful I found these. I love going to thrift stores and finding unusual jewelry, but many times the backings aren't original or well fitting. These put my heavier statement earrings back into rotation --they passed the test and had my earrings secure for the whole day. I'll probably be using them from now on with all of my earrings because I feel so safe using them. So, so happy I bought these, thank you so much!",1
Wow! merveilleuse invention! Je ne perd plus mes pr√©cieuses boucles d'oreille! Je vais le recommander √† toutes mes amies!,1
Perfect!  I love these earring backs.  They are so secure.  Shipped quickly!,1
These are great! They work as advertised and my earrings don‚Äôt budge. Easy to use and comfortable. Probably a little overpriced in my opinion but I don‚Äôt know of any other option to prevent you from loosing your earrings so it‚Äôs worth it.,1
"Beautiful jewelry! Great quality and it shipped fast. Only issue is that on the shop page the seller claims that the items are shipping from the U.S., however, I was charged a foreign transaction fee. I even had my results filtered on the Etsy app to only show those shipping from the U.S. If I would have known this, I would have used a different credit card to avoid the fee. Just want others to be aware before ordering!",1
"The climbers are pretty, solid, nicely made. I bought the climbers to hide some of my old piercings.",1
Loved it!!! Fast shipping to EU,1
Just what I wanted. Love these!,1
These are so cute and dainty! Super light too :) Love the subtle color; will definitely be wearing these a lot!,1
I love these so much! They look amazing and are very comfortable.,1
"These are gorgeous and well-made. They look great on and are excellent if you want an earring that lays flat against your ear. My only complaint is that they are tight. I may have ""thicker"" earlobes than these are intended for and can get uncomfortable after several hours. I may get a second earlobe piercing and then I think they would be perfect.",1
"I love these Lapis Lazuli earrings!
They are fabulous!
Thank you!",1
To Nepalma thank you so much for taking your time to customize my order. Im very happy with my earrings. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments already :) .,1
"Les boucles d'oreille sont tr√®s jolies mais ne correspondent √† celles que j'avais command√©es. elles √©tait dans le m√™me style mais celle que j'avais command√©es √©taient rouges et celles que j'ai re√ßu √©tait vertes. 
Heureusement, la personne √† qui je les ai offerte adore le vert et portait justement ce jour l√† un pull de la couleur des boucles d'oreille. finalement une bonne erreur.",1
"Lively, cheerful everyday earrings. They are light, comfy and add a little bit of brightness to anything you might wear.",1
I bought these earrings during current lockdown for my Son‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs 40th birthday. Beautifully designed and made. Arrived on time. Will definitely buy from this supplier again.,1
I love this. Really handy just to throw over your shoulder when you don't want a handbag with you. The purse us big enough though to put your car keys in and that all important mask. I got the mustard and the colour is fab. Had loads of compliments - I would definitely recommend it,1
Beautiful! Exactly what I wanted to attach to an ornament made from Grandmother's wedding dress. Beautifully engraved.,1
"The earrings were beautiful, there was more contrast between the different coloured stars than could be seen in the photo. 
The quality of the earrings exceed expectation and I will definitely be buying more jewellery from this shop.",1
"Oh my goodness these are beautiful. I love the way the back of the earring is set up, it keeps it balanced and so so much easier to keep on. I had gotten another pair somewhere else and they were studs and just kept falling down. Not with these!!! Obsessed. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"I just received my Star Ear Crawler Earrings, they are very comfortable and they fit perfectly.   I would recommend this shop - VermeilSupplies to everyone!   I just placed another order from this shop, Moon Phase Ear Crawler Earrings and I can't wait to get them!  Thanks for the great pair of earrings!   Tim and Angela Jurgensen",1
"It's perfect!   Looks exactly like the photo, very light and delicate and stays in place with no problem.   Love it!",1
Absolutely love these ear climbers! They came super quick and are such good quality!,1
Went perfectly with my gold dress! Made it in plenty of time for my event.,1
These earrings really catch the light.  They are stunning!  My daughter has a pair of these earrings.  The way these earrings catch the light made me want a pair too!,1
"I am very satisfied with this shopping, i think this is coolest ear climbers ever! 
Thank you!",1
"These are my first ear climbers and they're so cute! I bought them for my birthday since I'm a Cancer. I like the shop's astrology constellation and birthstone ear climber collections.

The earrings arrive in a tiny glass bottle (think 1"") with a cork to keep them safe & in shape. Make sure to pinch the back firmly enough for the ear climber to stay put, but loose enough to be comfortable.",1
This is such a unique piece!  I wore it for my celestial-themed wedding and got so many nice compliments.  A very special addition to my wardrobe on my special day. :),1
"Just received my earrings and LOVE them! The packaging is adorable (these are a gift and the packaging is seriously going to add to the cute factor, very nice touch!) The earrings look exactly as pictured! Very happy, thank you!",1
"Though there were some serious mishaps with shipping by no fault of the seller (the package was stuck in customs for about a month), I am so, so happy with this purchase! These earrings are dainty and adorable, and they are great quality. Plus, they came in the cutest wrappings! I can't wait to give these as a gift! I would definitely recommend, but make sure to leave ample time for shipping.",1
"These earrings are stunning!! I have quite small ears, so the bottom jewel doesn‚Äôt sit close to my ear but it looks cute despite! I was so glad these earrings are true to being ‚Äòdainty‚Äô as these were the perfect size for my tiny ears! Will buy from again in futureüíú",1
They're finally here! They took about 20 days to come in because of the corona virus but they are perfect. Exactly like they were pictured and the sparkle is just beautiful. Thank you Lia!!!,1
"Lovely,very eye catching!!",1
So cute and comfortable! Simple design but the jacket makes it just a little ~fancy~ Great quality and fast shipping!,1
These earrings are completely awesome! I ended up getting a few other pairs shown in the picture as well. Everything was presented beautifully and really high quality. Gracy was so sweet and did an incredible job making these items. I highly recommend this shop!,1
"The earrings took a little while to arrive but that was expected, as they were shipped from the other side of the world. They are beautiful! I got them to go with a rose gold necklace of mine and I really like that they are unique, simple, and elegant. Thank you!!!",1
These earrings are easier to put on than the jacket type with a similar look. They look terrific on. I love them!,1
LOVE these earrings! And I was even gifted a cute letter ‚Äúe‚Äù ring complimentary with my order. Love the simple aesthetic and shipped surprisingly fast to the US!,1
"I LOVE these earrings! I have the hammered silver ones. They can be dressed up or down, always get compliments on them! Love them so much that when I lost one traveling, I bought the pair immediately again!",1
These earrings are perfect!! They look exactly like they do in the photos! They are delicate enough for everyday wear. I have gotten so many compliments in these! Since of my faves now!,1
Thank you so much for these beautiful earrings. I love them!! Just what i hoped for and clearly made with such care.,1
"some ear jackets are too large, this is just right. Combined with the teardrop and I have a perfect set.",1
"I'm wearing these a lot! And getting lots of compliments. Great quality, great design!",1
"I love these earrings, I have worn them everyday since receiving them. I really loved the wood display they come on too. Thank you",1
"Excellent transaction! Seller had good communication, shipped in a timely manner, and the packaging / presentation of the earrings exceeded my expectations!",1
"Best purchase I've made in a long time, quality is superb! I've worn them every day since I got them and gotten so many compliments because they are so beautiful and unique, thank you Otis Jaxon!",1
"Beautiful gorgeous earrings! More stunning when seen in person than on the screen. Needless to say, very stylish when worn! Really happy with my purchase.",1
My favs. So gorgeous and different to everyone else. Quality is exceptional and packing is gift worthy,1
Delivery was really  great and super  fast!!! It comes in a a cute little  package. Earring are a fabulous  silver item that really stands out!!!,1
"I‚Äôve  been searching for Ear Crawlers that speaks to me, and I cannot believe this is the most beautiful set, and my very first pair of Ear Crawlers that I finally found.  They are exquisitely made and stunning!  This is truly an artist at work....packaged very nicely...I am thrilled and will always appreciate them.  Thank You...",1
"I love love love it so beautiful, I have received many compliments. Shipping was fast considering it came from a great distance.",1
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!,1
"I ordered the earrings based on the pictures and reviews by other customers. I am so happy I did! They are beautiful and perfect for my inner ear, conch piercing!!! The packaging was great and the delivery was fast, too!",1
Love that it is dainty yet stands out and goes well with so many of my other jewelry!,1
Everything was perfect. The item is excellent. Shipping was fast.,1
Super pretty climbers. Thank you.,1
These are well made and go with casual or dressier outfits,1
"Love it. So different looking I receive  compliments every time I wear it. 

Thank you",1
I bought two items from this shop and love them!! The seller is fantastic and stayed in touch with me throughout the delivery processs.,1
Not my favorite. I buy a lot of these climbers and this one felt very breakable. It measures correctly but on the average ear it doesn‚Äôt go all the way up like pictured. It‚Äôs an odd shape that doesn‚Äôt sit comfortably on the ear which maybe difficult because everyone has different ear shapes. The earnings came in a very tiny ring box and were slightly bent when I received them. Not worth the 53 dollars I spent.,1
"Once again,I am over the moon with these gorgeous ear climbers. They are so different and so comfortable to wear.I love the colours,which is a nice added bonus.
And guess what??!! I've just bought another pair lol..I just can't keep awayüòâ
Thank you so much üíñ xxxx",1
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase.",1
"These are so cute, I'm completely in love with them! Fast shipping too- will purchase from again!",1
"love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped. Went in easter basket.",1
Obsessed with these.,1
These earrings are gorgeous!  I get constant compliments on them.  They require a little fiddling and squeezing to get them to stay in place.,1
"It's beautiful, comfortable, stays in place, and exactly as pictured! It also is one of the few earrings I can wear that doesn't irritate my sensitive ears.  I love it and have gotten so many compliments on it already.  Thank you Kristen!",1
"The rose gold ear climbers are a beautiful color just as I hoped.  They stay in place quite well.  Sometimes my hair catches them but that's the life with a lot of crazy waves.  They go up almost half way up my ear, were easy to put in and they are classy and funky with out being ""too much"" to wear to an office, interview, etc.  They arrived quickly and were packaged nicely.  I would purchase from Glamrock again.",1
Love these! Wore them to a wedding and received so many compliments on how gorgeous they were.,1
"These earrings are so beautiful, also versatile. I put the hoop jacket on to dress up and where the circular studs all of the time.",1
"The earrings are just what I asked for and very feminine, too.  The workmanship is excellent.  Packaged well and fast arrival.  Thank You!",1
Received on time and very pretty! Love the polished silver!,1
These earrings are amazing! I didn't want anything too big just simple and dainty and these earrings are exactly that! So happy with my purchase and so happy with the quality. Thanks again!,1
Great little earrings! I was nervous because I wanted to wear these in my third holes but they are small enough that they look great even that far up my earlobe without going into the part where my ear curls over. Comfy enough to sleep in (though I usually turn them face down) which is what I wanted and it was really hard to find a climber earring that didn't have a stud back. The back also is adjustable for how tight it is which is nice and no irritation from wearing them for a long time. Highly recommend!,1
Beautiful delicate climbers. Clearly well made. I'm so excited to have them. They didn't take long to arrive either. Love love love them. Thank you so much!!!!,1
I love this piece of jewelry! They are just beautiful! Thank you so much!,1
"Beautiful set of earrings, you can wear it as a single stud or a jacket! I love the adjustable aspect of the jacket as well! Love it!",1
"I love these! I've always had issues with small earrings looking like they've disappeared in my ear lobe because of the shape, but these don't! They're super simple for everyday wear, but you can also use them for something a little fancier!",1
"I love this earrings very much, it shipped on time; the seller is great and I definitely purchase more items from her.",1
Super cute!!!,1
"I LOVE these earrings! Oak leaves and acorns are my family‚Äôs thing (because of the saying ‚ÄúMighty oaks from little acorns grow.‚Äù) so these earrings are very special to me. They are well made and beautiful! I‚Äôd buy the other earring set available too if the two earrings were mirror images of each other. Also, if there were a bar style necklace with a chain soldered to each side of this curved oak branch, I‚Äôd buy it too. I definitely recommend these earrings!",1
"Charming little acorn + oak leaf earrings with lots of pretty detail! üçÇ Very sophisticated, too. Many thanks, Joanna!",1
I ordered these as a Thank You grift for my oldest sister/ Bridesmaid. She is incredibly picky but when I showed her these she LOVED them. They are delicate and beautiful in person.  Each item is handmade and comes in an adorable package as well! Shipping was also super easy and fast!,1
Beautiful dainty oak branches! Expertly and we'll made. Definitely my new favorites!!! A++++,1
These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made!  They look very nice on the ear.  Very comfortable to wear.  Shipping was very quick.  Would definitely buy from this seller again! They came in a very nice little bag made of soft material.  Very pleased with purchase!  Thank you for making these ear cuffs!,1
Beautiful! Worth every penny I love them!,1
"Shipped on time, tried em on and they look so cool! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them for my wedding!!!",1
In love and I need more!!! Thankyouuuuu,1
These earrings are so beautiful! I receive many compliments on them! Shipping was fast and packaged so cute! Will definitely order again!,1
I received this a few days ago. I also purchased the white gold for the left ear. I am so beyond happy with these. They are stunningly pretty and fit perfectly on my ears. I also have very sensitive ears and certain earrings can cause irritation but that doesn‚Äôt happen with these at all! Love them!,1
"Very quick shipping. 
The earrings are so pretty and I have been getting so many compliments on them. My Mom loved them so much that she asked me to order a pair for her, which I did right on the spot, last night :) So I've ordered 2 pairs in less than a week and plan to order some more items soon!",1
I asked for flat gold discs instead of the little ball studs and was accomodated! These are high quality- you can feel it in the weight of the product. They look super cool and are what I envisioned and wanted in an ear jacket set. I really appreciate the ability to set how low or high you want the jacket to be. It's bound to be as snug or as low as you want it! Thank you so so much!!,1
These are awesome! I love them! Very very light and comfortable. I can wear my headphones at work without the post hurting me. Lots of compliments on them too! These look WAY better than my picture shows.,1
Exactly what I was looking for! Love them thank you so much!,1
They're gorgeous wearing them in the day of my wedding üòç,1
Really beautyful!,1
"These earrings are BEAUTIFUL,  so well made, really quality pieces, well worth the wait, thank you so much!!",1
"It‚Äôs perfect! Great quality, love the tiny diamonds. It  has the right look to balance with other earrings I plan to wear with it. The service is excellent. I initially ordered a different size but it turned out to be too small. Thanks to the super fast shipping, I was able to try it on, then order a new size (6.5 mm, left earring shown in photo) while the sale was still on. Returning the one that didn‚Äôt fit was easy.",1
I‚Äôm always blown away with my purchases from SV! Diamond huggie earrings are AMAZING and shipping to Australia was so fast. Just in time for my birthday - thank you!,1
"I ordered these on Friday and received them Monday! They are so tiny but (luckily) fit perfectly in second hole. These are very well made with a secure clasp and beautiful sparkly diamonds. 
I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely order from them again!",1
This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!,1
"One of the jewel‚Äôs prongs weren‚Äôt closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day.",1
"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!",1
These earrings are incredibly beautiful and unique and will be perfect for my wedding day. They also arrived very quickly and in lovely packaging. Very glad to have found this shop!,1
"Love these! I was a little nervous by looking at them that they‚Äôd be hard to put in, but that‚Äôs not the case at all. They are delicate and pretty and I forgot I actually had them in until I got complimented several times!",1
"These climbers are stunning! Very lightweight sterling silver too! I don't feel as though they would slip down my ear at all! Very happy with my purchase, thank you üòä",1
Beautiful ear clips!! Very satisfied!,1
"Truly beautiful, came quickly.  Thanks!",1
LOVE! I didn't realize how small it really is; I was ecstatic about how cute & little it was. Perfect fit & lovely details. Thanks!!,1
"I knew I would love these when I saw them on Etsy.  However,
I reeeeeeally LOVE them in person.  They are a beautiful delicate quality of sterling silver.  The price is worth it.  Prompt delivery and wrapped with class and care.  Very Happy.......Thank you!!",1
"Love this earring! Fits the curve of my ear perfectly and is super cute! The detailing is also best in person, very nice work!",1
Omg super fast arrival wish everything I bought on here was as fast!! And earring was even better then I expected I'm so excited to wear it!! Thank u MGMETAL!!,1
I ordered these as a gift and sort of waited to the last minute ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (totally my bad). I was concerned that they wouldn‚Äôt come quick enough due to COVID and possible delays. I reached out to Amy and she was super responsive and told me to place the order that night and she‚Äôd pop them in the mail the next day. My did she deliver! They got here quicker than I had hoped and are just beautiful! My friend loves them and wears them everyday as a second-hole staple. They‚Äôre so cute and extremely comfortable- you can sleep with them in. Really beautiful craftsmanship and amazing customer service. I‚Äôll definitely shop from Amy again. Thank you SO much!,1
These earrings were exactly what I imagined when I ordered minimalist gold climbers. Very comfortable and beautiful. Quickly became my favorite earrings for my sensitive ears!! Highly recommend.,1
"Third purchase of these great little ear pins over the years. They are my go-to ""stud"" so they do get lost occasionally :) There are many versions of this style available on Etsy, but I find this design and execution the most-elegant. Squirrels Nest always has great customer service, can do custom design work, and ships quickly.",1
The earring was so very cute and a unique piece that got lots of compliments!! This shop had the best communication and was super friendly; my earring came in in just a few weeks!,1
Very pretty ring.  Just like the picture.  I get a lot of compliments!,1
"Speedy delivery of beautiful acorn earrings. I love them so much, this is the 3rd pair that I have bought. Well done x",1
This ring is beautiful! I love how dainty and elegant it is! Took a while to come but was worth the wait!,1
My first parcel didn't arrive so I got in touch with Gemma and she sent me another parcel which arrived next day I am very pleased with my paw earrings and will definitely buy off Gemma again.,1
Speedy delivery of beautiful acorn earrings. I love them and have had lots of compliments about them today. Well done x,1

Love them so much! So dainty. I‚Äôve received so many compliments. Super fast shipping too!,1
"Wish I could give the customer service more than five stars!.. she was so helpful and so kind!üòä

Although I had a slight problem with the earrings at first, she was kind so and willing to do all that she could to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I wear these earrings EVERY day! They‚Äôre so so cute. ü•∞",1
"I purchased these for my sister in rose gold, and she loved them! They are well made and just as described. My sister has her ears double pierced, so wears them in her second hole, with statement earring in her first piercing. They look awesome and now I want a pair! :) I would definitely recommend these!",1
Fast shipping--I love this design and have received many compliments in these unique earrings! Comfortable as well! Thank you!,1

Thank you so much..These arrived today.They are so beautiful..Lots of love & care in these earrings..A gift to my daughter for her wedding day..I would highly recommend this store..Aya Jewellery.,1
"This is what I sent to the beautiful creator of my bridal jewelry- 


Thank you so much you have truly made my day ideal and so easy with this. Your pieces are beautiful and beyond honestly. I really wanted to get your head piece too truth be told! But what you have created is magic. Just know you‚Äôre changing people‚Äôs dream since they were little because you did mine ‚ú®

I am so thankful to come across her page IF YOU ARE EVEN THINKING OF BUYING. Omg let me tell you it is so stunning when you get your pieces. It matches my dress perfect but also me as well. My day hasn‚Äôt come yet but when it does and I have my photos I will most definitely share.",1
"Loved these! They are just as beautiful and sparkly in person. Wore them for my wedding day and plan to wear them for many more weddings/events I attend. The only issue was the size of the holes in the ear jacket itself. The earring posts only fit in some (not all) of the holes, so I couldn't wear them on the lower setting I wanted to (since only one side fit through). I wore them on a higher setting so the ear jacket sat lower. They still looked great, just not quite the look I was going for.",1
Lovely earrings and great communication!,1
"Absolutely love the necklace, thank You!",1
"Absolutely stunning earrings. Exactly as described/pictured and very high quality. Shipped immediately and received only two days after purchase! 
The seller is so helpful and easy to communicate with. I have bought four items so far and will definitely purchase again from this shop.",1
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©",1
"I bought one for my left as I have longer hair over my right ear. I like funky unusual earrings and this fits the bill. I love it. I just can't wait for lockdown to be lifted so I can show it off. Everything went well, with swift delivery. I look forward to finding some delightful jewellery off you in the near future, thank you xx",1
"Breathtaking piece!  so beautiful!  I will definitely be ordering more!  sturdy, sparkling and the perfect shade of rose gold.  cute packaging also!",1
"I love this earrings, they look like real mini cookies and they are even cuter than I though.
The shipping was fast, they were carefully wrapped and came with a lovely handwritten message (thank you very much ü•∞).
Just one thing, they are smaller than depicted. The description says they are L and W 1.8 cm but mine are a little less than 1.4 cm.
Either way, they are lovely and look amazing üôÇ",1
Really pretty with cute little details. They even came with a handwritten note and a piece of candy. I will definetely buy more!,1
"Great product it‚Äôs 14k marked. Great quality, will definitely purchase again.",1
They are just as described on website.  Nice size too.  Like the 14kt gold.,1
"Gorgeous, good quality and unique, just as I've come to expect from ShlomitOfir. Thank you so much.",1
"Absolutely stunning!!! Fit perfectly!  Can‚Äôt wait to wear them out.  Nickel free, I‚Äôm going to purchase another pair as soon as I‚Äôm done writing this review!! üñ§ 

Jamie in PA",1
LOVE!!!,1
I bought these for my wedding for a unique look. I feel like they look and feel cheap and not sure if I am going to wear them yet.,1
Amazing -- and exactly as described. Love it. So unique. Thanks very much!,1
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture..

Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle",1
"Bought this as a guard for a ring that was my mother‚Äôs. That ring is a bit big and the setting is curved and low, so a straight band doesn‚Äôt sit well. This is perfect!  Diamonds are small but very sparkly in the light!!  Great purchase and will be buying another for the bottom!!",1
My wife absolutely loves her new ring! We upgraded her wedding ring! It's better than expected!  It's beautiful & perfect! Thank you! Scott,1
Absolutely stunning ring! My husband loves it ‚ù§Ô∏è Customer service was so friendly when I called about shipping! Highly recommend.,1
Love my new earrings! They came super quick and were packaged with care! Definitely going to order more,1
"These earrings were cute, and a big success at my daughter's superhero party. Thank you.",1
Love these they're so adorable and I have gotten so many compliments particularly when I went to go see Infinity War at the cinema! Thank you!,1
even cuter in person ^-^ my friend loved them,1
"I love these earrings! I will say that shipping was exceptionally slow, with no tracking info shared, and the seller could have been more responsive. That said, the product was worth it!!

**EDIT, these have become my favorite jewelry I‚Äôve ever owned and have held up extremely well with being slept in and worn constantly. So worth it!!!",1
"I am in love with these earrings. They also have an adjustable post (on the dangling piece) to accommodate short or long earlobes - so thoughtful! I also received a small gift in addition to the order. These are handmade pieces, so expect some time for your delivery, but it was worth the wait! <3",1
üíñ love it,1
The earrings arrived in perfect condition and the owner was great about keeping me updated on shipping !!,1
I am glad I got the smaller size because they are a bit on the heavy side. The floral pattern makes these hood special.,1
The earring jackets are more beautiful than in the photo. They complement my small diamond stud earrings beautifully. They arrived on time and care was taken in the shipping. I am extremely pleased!,1
Lovely design and quality.  Quick service.  Love the custom options available at such a reasonable price.  Thank you!,1
Beautiful pair of ear jackets!!,1
"Cutest shop ever! They sent my products in this item bitty teeny ring box and sent an Easter candy along with it. Shipping was incredibly fast, was super suprised to see it in the mailbox already. This particular product is super amazing, the 6mm was the perfect size for my daith piercing (although it WAS a pain to screw the ball on because it was so short to my ear, but that's not the products fault, it's just because I prefer it to be very snug and short in my ear). The fire opal is super cute, very colorful. I got all white opal so all my earrings were cohesive and matching and this particular opal is very pretty! 10/10 would reccomend. Also, quality was awesome, I know some people could be skeptical buying online but this was great and all pieces soaked wonderfully in rubbing alcohol",1
"I ordered the blue opal for my new daith piercing (almost healed!) The piercing itself is subtle, so I am very excited for this little pop of aqua in my otherwise, silver- filled ear. The colors glow in the light! I am very excited to get this little gem in my ear next week. The jewelry is gorgeous :)",1
"I ordered the ‚Äúdaith‚Äù piercing, 16G curved barbell, I picked blue opal & a gold bar. The shipping was super fast and the jewelry is beautiful!! I am wearing it in my vertical labret and I absolutely love it.",1
"It is absolutely stunning! Fits absolutely beautifully, and compliments the lip so well! 
Update: I went to tighten it today and the opal ball actually came off by itself. Still beautiful, but the ball will probably fall off by itself while I sleep or something, and I won't be able to find it.
Update again: Just fell off.",1
"I love these earrings so much they have been the only earrings I have worn in the past 2+ years. They dont bother me when sleeping, which was my main reason for buying, and always look great. The only reason I‚Äôve had to buy earrings since I first got a pair from here is because I have had them occasionally fall out and get lost- so I just replace them (love that I can buy one at a time)! All styles of the climber earrings at this shop get five stars from me.  Shipping is fast and the packaging is lovely. Can‚Äôt recommend enough.",1
"Love these earrings! I did have to use little stoppers on the ends bc I didn‚Äôt feel them secure enough, but they‚Äôre so beautiful!!

Thank you!",1
Beautiful earrings. The climbers have a long back piece that is more narrow at the base than at the top. I think it is designed this way to help secure them in place but my lobe is slightly big for the narrow part. It doesn't cause much of an issue just every so often they pop out of place a bit. They took a bit of adjusting to see how they fit best on my lobe. Otherwise they look and feel great! I have been admiring these for a while so I was happy to finally take the plunge and be satisfied with my purchase :-),1
So beautiful. I‚Äôm obsessed! Thank you so much!,1
"Love, love, love, love, LOVE! Did I mention I love these earrings? Fast shipping, and received them yesterday. Wearing at work today! Can‚Äôt say enough, thank you!",1
"Angie is absolutely amazing! She will work with you on designing anything! These are a classic with an exciting twist, not too over the top, but also just noticeable enough. I will always go to her for jewelry!!",1
Classy and stunning.  The halos add elegance and charm.  I have paired these beauties with both the rose and turquoise bracelets in this order.,1
I'm SO in love with these earrings for my wedding! Thank you thank you thank you ‚ô°,1
"I love everything lavender, so these were prefect! I just had a baby recently and she is now grabbing at things...she won't be able to pull these!
Arrived in a timely manner considering Covid and the fact that they came from across the world. V
The attention to detail is awesome, I got them in the rustic silver. I'll update with a picture later. I am a happy client!",1
"Since these are made to order, be prepared to be patient. They are well worth it! They look even better in person and are so comfortable I forget I‚Äôm wearing them! I feel like I have a bit of nature preserved and adorning my ears. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy from this shop!",1
I love those. They came very quickly and they‚Äôre superbe. One of my favourite pairs and that‚Äôs saying a lot. Special delicate sprigs of lavender that make me feel elf-like ^-^ I so do adore this shop.,1
Why I did order just only on. I'm ordering one more and other pieces of collection right after I finish this review :) So beautiful you can wear every day or like me: on your brothers wedding :),1
"WOW! I love it! This is the first ear climber I've ever had and I was worried about the fit- This came in and I popped it on so easily. It feels very secure without pinching me and I can't even tell I'm wearing it. I also got the dark pearls with gold drips and am equally impressed with those. The seller was very forthcoming about how the shipping ended up being delayed due to world events, and I never felt worried about it.",1
"This earring is so cool! I love it. The quality and craftspersonship is wonderful. They packaged it with great care for shipping. Included a cleaning cloth and how to care card. The jewelry box it came in is lovely, unique looking and perfect size for storage to keep it safe from being bent. I will definitely order from Mariejune again.",1
These ear crawlers are absolutely gorgeous and such amazing quality. I can‚Äôt stop staring at them. They also make you look so chic! Totally worth the wait!,1
"Love the look, love the quality, look the packaging
Edit update: so many compliments on this jewelry üò≥üò≥üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again.",1
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too.",1
very nice earrings. Quick to arrive,1
"So so happy with these! Beautiful rose gold colour that go with anything I wear, sit really comfortably and I've had many a compliment whilst wearing. Super quick service would highly recommend. Thank you",1
Perfect ear climber for my third hole. Very happy with everything that I purchased. And shipping was very fast!,1
This item definitely exceeded my expectations & are by far my favorite earrings atm. Was a little worried about the shipping being the time it would come but it came in a timely fashion(hehe). Can't wait to check out the other items from this shop & highly recommend at least talking a look it's worth it.,1
"Cathy was absolutely wonderful at responding and catering to my wishes - she spent a lot of time talking with me about chain sizes, colours, and even expanded her chain collection to offer more choices. The necklace itself is dainty and gorgeous, perfect chain size and colour and is very petite and beautiful. Thank you!",1
"Bought as an anniversary gift, and its just perfect, thank yo uso much! Very quick delivery, and the pieces themselves are lovely.",1
Gorgeous glittery ear climbers!  Simple to put on and looks great on the ears.,1
Gorgeously beautiful ear climbers. As much as I ordered few more for my daughter and myself. The note attached is heartwarming üíï Thank you!,1
Absolutely love these crawlers! My favorite earrings I have.,1
"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my purchases! If you order, be prepared regarding the shipping. It probably could have been delivered faster via Pony Express (‚Äúshipped‚Äù on Feb 4 from NY & arrived Feb 27 in Louisiana with USPS First-Class PKG). BUT the wait was well worth it! I promise. I love the items, I‚Äôll do it again and again!",1
"I'm in love with these earrings! They are so delicate, elegant and stylish, and the customer service is great as well. Definitely recommend!",1
"I ordered these Gorgeous earrings to wear on my honeymoon and was worried they may not arrive in time to wear them (especially as most things are delayed due to the pandemic).
The seller was so wonderful and sent the item so speedily that they arrived early and so well packaged.
The earrings are so beautiful, so dainty and very unique and I am so happy with my purchase and the customer service that I will be ordering again soon! THANKYOU!! #HappyBride x",1
I love the ear climbers but am having trouble with the cuffs.  I think it's just my weird ears! I can't even feel the ear climbers but they are so elegant when I catch sight of them in the mirror.,1
"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them.",1
"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!",1
"I love ‚ù§Ô∏è them so much. I wear them constantly and that's saying a lot for me because I very rarely wear silver, usually only hold, but I am so happy with these earrings and hey are so cool looking that I've had to adjust my preferences! Haha. Definitely get tons of inquiries and compliments. So dainty and easy to put on and they look just wonderful. Very happy with my purchase.",1
"The serotonin pair of earrings are beautiful! I love wearing these on my ears. Once you figure out how to slip them on and off your ears, they are very low maintenance during the day that I almost forget I'm wearing them. It came packaged in a small jar with a care card which also make for a cute display in my jewelry area.",1
"Great items. Ear jacket is the perfect size. A bit hard to put on first time but it's very elegant looking . The small earrings are dainty and beautiful, have enough detail despite their size. Both stay put in ears. The metal backs of the earrings were hurting me so I replaced with rubber backs. Seller shipped quickly and prices are fair. Awesome purchase!",1
"These are great! I love the adjustable backing. Turns out my ears are different sizes, so they need to be on different holes but they still look even.",1
Second pair. Love this shop! My 1st pair was the black in this style and now I have the gold. So so so many compliments on these at work! Thank you,1
"These earring jackets are cute, casual, and perfect for everyday wear. They coordinate well with most of my stud earrings, while adding some pizzazz. I also like the fact that they are adjustable.  They were very reasonably priced, and arrived earlier than expected.  Would highly recommend this seller and this item.",1
I love my climbers earrings! They are super fun and wonderful quality! Really cool look!!! I have already received multiple compliments!!! Thank you so much!!!,1
These earrings are so beautiful- the color is gorgeous! They feel very secure and I get so many compliments on them. Highly recommend them!,1
"Absolutely amazing! So in love with every single piece I own from Otis Jaxon. Incredible designs, high quality and unique. Thank you.",1
"The earrings are wonderful! The first time I wore them, someone asked me if I'd had my ears double-pierced. Ha! They're well-made, with both tips perfectly rounded, and although they're thin and light-weight, they seem substantial when you handle them. They were shipped quickly, so I'm very pleased!",1
"Nice quality silver wire .... But this is really just an open-ended wire loop without any smooth closure. Looks sort of like your hoop earring has flipped up and become caught in your ear.... doesn't nestle or fit very well. May work better with other shapes, I purchased the circle.",1
Much smaller than I thought it would be but it‚Äôs still a very cool looking piece of jewelry. Arrived very quickly too!,1
"I don't know why I waited so long to purchase these. Seriously, they are the cutest little dainty ear jackets! Love the little spirals and curls, they are charming. Plus the phenomenal packaging - they come in a great little box, with anti tarnish strip, and the earrings are clipped onto a tree slice, words don't do it justice but it's fancy and perfect if you're wanting to gift these to someone very lucky! Photo doesn't do the box justice. I am pleased (very pleased!) with this purchase and highly recommend the seller.",1
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I am in love with them! I just received them yesterday and I have already gotten a couple compliments on them too! Amazing! :-),1
"This earrings couldn't be anymore awesome. They came nicely placed in a little wooden slice, with a piece of polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish paper. The work is delicate, excelent, and the overall look is super dainty and elegant. I love them, and I'm sure I will be back in the future, totally recommended shop!",1
"Really Beautiful! Just as pictured and the packaging was a beautiful bonus. My ONLY disappointment is not quality or service related and can't remedied without custom work, but I want to mention it so you are aware. When wearing these earrings as pictured here, the back piece hangs down more than I'd like it to on MY ears. This is due to the position of the hole in my ear and consequently a narrow lobe. However, this may not be the case for your ears. I was just hoping the back piece would 'cup' my ear, not hang down so low. I still love them and wear them the other way! They were worth the wait and actually arrived sooner than I expected, considering where they came from (I'm in the US). So, still an all around 5 Stars.",1
"I love these, so awesome! I love that I can add the jackets to any stud that I already have! I have received so make compliments on them too! Thank you!",1
beautifully made and super stylish! I loved wearing these to a recent music festival and always feel unique and confident when I wear them out to the bars or shows! thanks so much!!,1
I absolutely love these Starburst jackets and bar studs.  They are perfect!,1

These are so unique! Seller had great communication,1

Gorgeous. Love her ear climbers.,1

Beautiful earrings and much sturdier than what I bought on Amazon! I can tell they‚Äôre specially crafted.,1
"Really nice earrings, even better than I expected. The size is just right and they stay in their place well!",1
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!,1
I love the earrings! Excellent craftsmanship and service,1
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!,1
"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ",1
Magnifique... un rendu au top. Ce bijou va vite devenir une pi√®ce phare de ma  collection ! ‚ú®,1
"Just arrived 3 minutes ago.  Wow!  Just beautiful!  Many thanks.
Constance",1
The dark purple and green leaves are gorgeous and I‚Äôm sure my friend will love this as much as I did when I opened the parcel.,1
I absolutely love this ring! I bought this one for myself because it is my boyfriend's birthstone and he bought me the aquamarine one because it is our son's birthstone and they look amazing. Tanmay is wonderful and keeps you updated through the whole time. And the fact that the ring sizer was offered complimentary was the best thing because I wasn't sure of my ring size! Both were delivered super fast after they shipped. I have already recommended this shop to friends!,1
"LOVE THESE! I purchased as a set, order came quickly.  Ignore red in photo, I'm still piercing my setup of lining my ears with diamonds. These were a great touch!",1
Quality is better than I‚Äôd hoped for. Shipping was incredibly fast. I‚Äôm in love with the look but the ear climber may not lay flat against your ear. Or maybe I just have a weird ear. I still love it. Will definitely be buying more from this seller.,1
Absolutely wonderful earring! The quality is top-notch and shipping to Europe was extremely fast. Definitely will be back for more :),1
"I love these earrings so much, I had to purchase 2 full sets to get this look. (My ears match)WORTH IT.  Customer service is amazing, and items came very fast. When I am ready to add more diamonds, this is where I will purchase!",1
"Very pretty! They're a little large for my tiny ears, but I actually love the bolder look. The hooked backing ensures that they don't budge once they're on. Great earrings!",1
"I love, love, love these ear climbers.  I think I need another pair in rose gold. 
Looking forward to getting the pyramid pendant in the near future too!
Thank you Kristen - I love your work!",1
This artist so amazing. My piece was not as I had hoped. She let me return it and she custom-made me another piece. Her work is amazing; she is fantastic!,1
Better than I was expecting! So beautiful and such great quality. The shipping materials were very cute and professional. Would highly recommend. This is the best etsy shop I've ever bought jewelry off of. Definitely going to buy more from this seller! üòçüòçüòç,1
"These Earrings are beautiful! very bright and shiny material and the design is so unique.  Delivery time (standard shipping) was about 3-4 weeks, but the packaging was adorable and I am very happy with the product!",1
Love them! Even got send a free little ring ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
Love the simplicity of this earring.  Would have preferred metal backs.,1
"Love them! Lost one from my first pair, so I had to order another!",1
"I‚Äôve made about 4 purchases with this vendor, and I am beyond satisfied every time.  The jewelry is beautiful and lasts long, and it always arrives in a timely manner.",1
"I had bought a pair of these earrings in December and loved them so much...but I lost one somehow, probably putting a jacket hood up and down in the cold. I just had to order another pair. Fantastic and so pretty and unique!
Thank you again!",1
"They‚Äôre beautiful. The posts are much longer than expected, but I love them",1
"Absolutely beautiful! I love them!
Arrived very quickly...and well packaged.
Extremely pleased!",1
"This ear cuff earring is gorgeous! When I first bought it,  the cuff part wouldn't stay in place and kept hanging down. I wrote to the seller,  and she figured out a solution, by making the back of the cuff adjustable similar to some pierceless earrings.  She sent me the new one free of charge,  and it's perfect!",1
beautiful earings and very fast shipping .,1
I've just received my earring and I couldn't be more happy with it! Such a good quality and it fits perfectly.,1
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them! I'm very pleased with my purchase! Thank you!,1
I love them! They are adorable and comfortable. Thanks,1
"The item arrived quickly, I was a little surprised by how small it appeared.  I thought it would be a little larger.  I like it, though.",1
Looks great! Thank you so much!,1
It is a Christmas present.  I think my daughter will love them.,1
"I‚Äôm allergic to so many different types of jewelry and these don‚Äôt bother me at all. They are simple and elegant, and you can wear them two ways! If I‚Äôm going to work I don‚Äôt put the back piece on and it‚Äôs a cute stud, and with the back piece it elevates the look. Love the earrings.",1
"I bought my first pair of these in gold at WolfBait in Logan Square, Chicago. I had them for years and they were pretty much the only earrings I would wear. I was recently on a long walk and one of my earrings fell out. I couldn't find the missing piece so I decided to buy some new ones online. I saw that MinimaMaxima was in the process of moving (congrats!) and I requested an alert when the shop opened back up. As soon as I got the notification, I logged in and added a pair of these to my cart...I didn't even know they came in rose gold! My order arrived super quickly and was packed beautifully and with care. I LOVE the business card and packaging. I am so ecstatic to have these and I plan on buying another (backup) pair soon! Thank you all so much!",1
These are pretty but very fragile. I don't think I will have them long. The wire bends as you put them in your ears. But... They are very pretty!,1
Super cute.,1
Super cute !! Happy with my purchase!,1
"Cutest earrings ever!! and they arrived super quickly. I love them so much, thank you!",1
"Absolutely LOVE these! So unique :D Had some compliments on them too. 
I also suffer with allergies to nickel, chrome and gold and these are fine because they are as they say, silver 
Great service, thank you!",1
"I bought this as a gift and it is beautiful, and the packaging is so cute! Vera was very helpful and kind - I'll definitely be buying from her again!",1
"My ears have always been really sensitive to metals and these earrings are not only BEAUTIFUL, but they're treating my ding dang sensitive-as-heck ears very well. I love this simple, elegant design and I'm going to buy more pairs. Thank you!",1
Love these! I like how you have the option of just using the studs as well.,1
Perfect length (1.5‚Äù) to hang from my second to third hole! Love it!!,1
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!",1
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!",1
The 1 inch chain fit my conch piercing perfectly! It is soo pretty and dainty for a great price. It arrived just within the estimated delivery window listed.,1
"The creative idea of these earrings is amazing!
Giovanna Racca is very kind and attentive to the customer. The shipment is arrived very fastly. I'm very satisfied.",1
I absolutely love my marble earrings. Just what I was looking for! Thank you Giovanna!,1
"When you wear these unique earrings, you are guaranteed many compliments! It took a bit to get them in the mail, but the wait was worth it‚ù£Ô∏è",1
"Fast delivery, great quality. I gave four stars because the earrings is smaller than I understood from the photo. Maybe my ears are big? Very happy with this shop, I recommend it!",1
Exactly what I was wanting for my industrial piercing. I even asked to have the earring be a bit longer and my request was granted. Exceptional work for such a minimalist piece. Thank you!!,1
These are so unique and intricate! Very versatile and goes with any outfit. Already ordered more designs for myself and for Mother's Day!,1
i love it!! such a unique design.,1
Perfectly beautiful,1
BEAUTIFUL!! Can't wait to wear them.,1
"They came and they were absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, poor lasting quality. I never got to wear them. 2 months later, without ever being worn, without ever getting wet, the silver looks like it eroded right off and theyre turning brown like what happens with really cheap material, usually over time too not just 2 months. I will never be able to wear them and it was a waste. The stars are for how just freaking pretty they were when they came.",1
Beautiful and elegant. Customer service is lovely and helpful!,1
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)",1
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.,1
my boyfriend and I got these and we absolutely love them! I was worried it may be a little uncomfortable but its not one bit! so so happy!,1
"I love them soooo much. They arrived earlier than I thought and are soo beautiful. A bit smaler than they appeared on the fotos, but still amazing. I will definately order something from Thaya again!",1
"AMAZING 
Seller had gone way above just regular customer service!  Due to the pandemic the seller was unable to get to me the item that I originally wanted for the time line that I needed.  Michael communicated with me about this and once he learned what I was looking for he sent me options that were even better that my original sought purchase.  He arranged for express shipping based on my need and followed thru with communication till I received my purchase.
Shopping on line for higher priced items can be difficult, as we want the ability to hold touch and experience the quality before purchasing.  Michael made this obstacle a non issue with the experience he has and the extra care in communication.  I don‚Äôt consider myself a customer I will be a client that returns for many future purchases. 
Honestly just an amazing purchase",1
Absolutely in love with this ring. I bought the bottom one about 2 years ago and I wanted a second one to complete my set. Sage designs was easy to communicate with and made the ring exactly how I wanted it. It‚Äôs beautiful.,1
Wow! Love love love the earrings they are stunning! Surpassed my expectations in quality. Impeccably made and arrived so quickly. Thank you!,1
"The necklace far exceeded my expectations and is even more beautiful in person. I have seen similar baguette style necklaces that are much more expensive. I love the way the diamonds catch the light. If you love bling, this necklace is for you. It is very comfortable to wear and the clasp is easy to fasten. I custom ordered this necklace in 18k and it came certified in a lovely box. Micheal was a pleasure to work with and it came in a timely fashion with great communication from Michael along the way. I will definitely be ordering more pieces from this seller.",1
Absolutely gorgeous and so delicate and light catching! (I am referring to the silver triangle ear climbers).  My new favorite jewelry shop on Etsy! So lovely and very high quality.,1
Delicate but edgy! I've gotten alot of compliments on this piece and told ppl about SeoulLittle! This piece is easy to wear and lightweight,1
I just received these in silver today and they're gorgeous and high quality! I also love the container they came in as well as the personalized note. Love these!! :),1
"Triangle ear climber- what a great buy! I'm allergic to earrings so I have to be careful about the material, but these are as they are described which is huge! They are beautiful. Pricey- but the first earring that I can wear full time and I get so many compliments! I would suggest wearing one of these and buying the single triangle earing. It makes it an expensive buy... Wish they would make it a package deal!!",1
"These earrings look lovely on, I've had lots of compliments about them and lots of enquiries about where I bought them - I'm very pleased with them",1
"These earrings are very cool. My first ""ear climbers"" - something nice for a change from hoops and dangles. Well made, as described, and really decent ship time from the UK to Florida, USA. Thanks!",1
I love these!!  Very stylish and don't hurt my ears!,1
"I love these! Shipped the day I bought them and arrived 2 days later, very impressive. They‚Äôre lovely, good quality and I‚Äôm very pleased! Thank you üòä",1
"I love these they are beautiful, thank you x",1
"These are really lovely. I bought a couple of pairs for Christmas presents then decided I liked them so much I bought a pair for myself and my Mum! Can't wait to wear them on a night out when we're allowed to socialise again!
They also arrived promptly after ordering - was very impressed.",1
"I can‚Äôt describe the overwhelming feeling of quality that I felt when I opened this package. The necklace is simply gorgeous. I can not wait to wear it to the weddings that I will perform. This will not be my last purchase from this seller. I have to be honest, it takes a minute to arrive to the states, however, it‚Äôs well worth the wait! Love it!",1
These are going to be worn next month fir my wedding. I also ordered the matching necklace.  The quality is amazing!!,1
More beautiful than described. Bought them for my sister and she's in love with them! She finally has ear jewelry that she can wear that doesn't break her out. Thanks!,1
"Wow, these are stunning! The opals have such fire in them, even in dim lighting, and the quality (materials and craftsmanship) is superb - I'm really pleased with these! The ear climbers are also lightweight, comfortable and very secure - I actually forgot I had them on and went out for an evening run, and they still remained exactly as I had them! Tiff and Micah were amazing too with their communication. I asked if the climbers could be curved to match my ear shapes and they did exactly that - the fit is perfect ü•∞
Thank you Tiff and Micah for these!",1
"I LOVE these earrings! They're as perfect as I'd hoped they'd be. My mom saw mine and now she even wants a pair, so I really hope these come back in stock. Definitely gonna come back to this shop. Gonna add a pic to this review later.",1
"I absolutely loved making this suncatcher. The Youtube video made it easy to follow along, and is generally really well done. I had no experience prior to this and managed to create something that looks great. Seller is very forthright that there may be a shipping delay (it‚Äôs flagged right on the seller‚Äôs page). When my package arrived, it was wrapped with care and had everything I needed to complete the project (I bought the ‚Äòno pliers‚Äô option. You will need pliers. I just had my own). Will definitely be purchasing from this seller again, and I highly recommend them.",1
"Beautifully crafted! Ethiopian Opal 14k Gold Filled ear climbers, Opal flashy green fire ear crawlers, gemstone Opal ear pin, Opal ear vine ear cuff sweep",1
"Beautifully crafted! Was amazed at how it was even more stunning when I held the actual earrings! Fast delivery (despite the holiday rush, might I add!~), and incredibly helpful service through any concerns; will definitely be a loyal patron, and cannot wait to see this exceptional artisan's jewelry line grow!~ Again, happy holidays, and hope 2018 brings more happiness along with new inspirations and designs!~ :)",1
So beautiful.  Well made. Beautiful stones with flashes of colour. They are even prettier in person! Thank you!,1
Beautiful earrings and lovely seller. Shipping was very fast and the seller communicated promptly and effectively. I love my new earrings and can not recommend them enough!! Thank you!,1
It took a little while to get here but now that It's here I love it! I was slightly worried it would be too long but it sits in a nice spot on my ear and ends right at my conch. It even came with a cute sticker :) Very pleased to finally have something fun in my helix,1
"This piece is beautiful and I absolutely love it!!!  There was a bit of a hiccup with the post office in delivery, but Melanie was incredibly helpful and accommodating!",1
I am in love with this earring!,1
"The item shipped fast, and I love it! This is my second time purchasing from this shop, and I have been happy with all of the items I have purchased.",1
"I love it! It‚Äôs just like the pic! Althought mine came with a mark on it, like it was pressed and a part crumbled a bit, you cant really see it, so no problem. I also loved the message in the box and the fact the seller is eco-friendly and choses recycled and simple pack, which I do appreciate. 5 stars for her!",1
"These are my favorite earrings and I wear them almost daily. I have second and third lobe piercings, but I prefer these instead. They often slip out of position on one side (mostly just when I sleep), but I think that‚Äôs just because of the location of my piercing/size of my lobe compared to the width of the earring. I suggest taking them out before you shower, because I have come close to losing them down the drain a few times!",1
"Very nice, just like the photos. I have metal allergies but these earrings do not bother me at all.",1
"Unfortunately , have not yet rec'd the product, but I'll have to check with my wedding purchases, as the wedding will not take place  until mid September.  Thank you for checking in with me.  I LOVE Etsy!!!!",1
"Love the earrings, small and comfortable. :)",1
They are cute but one is backwards when you put it on.,1
Very fun to wear and no one else has them!,1
Really pretty and looks so good with my studs.  Thank you!,1
Wonderful! Came quickly. Nice dangly movement.,1
Thanks so much for the quick delivery.,1
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.,1
This is a lovely piece for my collection. I am happy it came with an extension because it‚Äôs a bit snug and I have a small wrist.,1
"So beautiful, it was worth the wait. I am happy I found the shop, and I will definitely buy something else. Only one suggestion, it would be good to have different sizes as it's quite tight on my hand, it would be nice to have it a bit looser. Otherwise, I recommend it to everybody.",1
"Obsessed with this ring! It shipped super fast which was amazing, and it such good quality. I absolutely love it!",1
Awesome product! Beautiful quality and fast shipping. My mum loves them üòç,1
"Absolutely beautiful ring!! Looks gorgeous by itself or stacked with others. I love it sooo much - super happy that I got the last one XD
Delivery was very quick despite all the Christmas and Covid delay warnings (I got it on the 14th, just 3 days after dispatch), and the lovely owner, Nat, kept in touch via Etsy as well as email the whole time. Packaging is also beautiful and classy for those who are buying gifts for others. I have been wearing the ring ever since it arrived and am definitely not taking it off any time soon. ZuZu has become one of my favourite shops and I will for sure be back for more.",1
"Wow, what a pair of beautiful earrings! They're very delicate and pretty. You don't even notice that you're wearing them, as they are extremely lightweight. The quality is exactly as pictured. I feel like it's hard to find dainty looking solid gold earrings (at least in Germany) so I'm super happy about these.",1
So tiny it just fits on my ear but it‚Äôs beautiful! Love it so much! üíñüíñ,1
"So fun and unique!  I love this cool ear climber.  It‚Äôs easy to put in, and stays in place. Plus it‚Äôs virtually weightless and easy on the ears, which after years of hoops is a welcome relief! Every bit as awesome as the picture!! Additionally, OtisJaxon provides excellent customer service and super fast shipping.",1
"I‚Äôve had these earrings for longer than a week (prior to being able to leave a review). The international shipping was lightning fast. Not to mention, I love how these earrings are unique enough to be worn as statement jewelry, but delicate enough to allow for other jewelry (I wore with large statement stone necklace).  Really awesome earrings!",1
"So cute!  Fast shipping, great quality, and I got compliments on them the first time I wore them!  Also great communication about when it would ship.",1
"I bought a square and a triangle to wear on each ear and it looks awesome! Love them, so unique!",1
The leaf details are exquisite! I also like the fact that it's an open ring so I can slightly adjust the ring to fit the finger I want to wear on perfectly ü•∞,1
I have not received this order.  3/18/2019,1
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!,1
"I wore these at my wedding, and they received so many compliments!",1
These earrings are gorgeous!! I personalized them to have black crystals with the turquoise stones and they turned out beautifully!,1
absolutely beautiful! Just like expected.,1
Ear jackets are very beautiful. Seller was wonderful. Will definitely buy again ‚ô•Ô∏è,1
"There are not enough words to express my appreciation for this seller's beautiful creations and more importantly the caring, attention and genuine kindness that comes with each item they sell.  You will likely be thrilled with whatever you get from this shop, but if there are any issues at all, you can rest assured they will work very hard to help find the best and most prompt solutions for their customers.  These folks care and we need LOTS more of that in today's world!",1
"My very first package I have purchased by Esty is arrived this morning from all the way from India.

It came with beautiful package and it was too pretty to open it but I opened then there was beautiful nose stud in pretty jewelry box.

I am very satisfied!",1
"I was so excited to receive this piece! I
was fawning over the precious bezel set pear shaped diamond ring in Madhulika‚Äôs shop. I asked if she could design something similar but as a threaded post. She happily obliged and  I was thrilled. Even though it is made to order, the turnaround time was exceptionally quick even with International shipping! The package was beautifully wrapped in natural muslin and embellished with elegant wax seals - I wish I‚Äôd taken a picture before my impatience got the best of me and I hastily tore it apart trying to get to its contents, hehe. But really, what a beauty this earring is and the quality is unparalleled! It sparkles and shines at every turn and I can‚Äôt wait to wear it.",1
"The ring was gorgeous. It was exactly what I was looking for! My engagement ring is a nontraditional stone and shape so finding a band that I loved and fit with it was difficult. It came in a reasonable time and is a beautiful, unique and quality product.",1
"I've been wearing this in the third hole in my left ear, so it climbs a little higher up the back of my ear. It's slightly too big for this, but I don't mind. Clearly, it's shown on the model fully on the earlobe instead of the back of the ear. I love this piece so much. It's gorgeous and I've been wearing it really often with another pair of earrings from this seller.",1
"Love these earrings, they are so dainty and light. Perfect for my sensitive ears. Shipping was fast too!",1
"I love these! They were exactly what I was looking for: cool, dainty, fun earring. You can tell it's high quality as well.",1
"Very pretty and comfy, I love that it sits flush to the earlobe in the back!",1
These are my new favorite ear rings!  So original and made really well.  Beautiful and simple.,1
"Nice, long thread, not as great as I would have picked if in person.",1
"Poor quality
Earring for a newborn not an adult
Gave the earrings to next door neighbor 2 year old daughter",1
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look.  Also the customer service was super responsive.,1
I am just in love. These have been on my favourites list for well over a year and I do ally bought them for my upcoming wedding! I wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner. They are absolutely stunning. Definitely an eye catching accessory and just like the picture. They arrived really quickly too! 5 stars all round!,1
"I loved this. It is a bit big for my ear, but it is super gorgeous.",1
Love the earings. They look unique and are very comfortable!!,1
"These are as beautiful as I had hoped and I loved, loved, loved the personalized card!  I wish you a wonderful 2017 and thank you so much for these wonderful earrings.",1
I love them!!!,1
These are gorgeous!  Arrived on time and beautifully packaged.  Thanks so much - MMR,1
very nice earrings!!!,1
"These are earrings I wear every day, clean once in a while and put back in. They are perfect for me! I have several ear holes and these go in the bottom. It took a long time for them to get to me... but worth the wait! Love them. Exactly as pictured. Great shop!",1
"Very delicate piece of work. I absolutely love the versatility and design of this earring! And it arrived in less than 10 days. The only thing I don‚Äôt love that much is putting it and removing it - as it has three pieces and they are quite small, it can be a blind guess to pick the correct height. But we can‚Äôt have everything, right? Otherwise, a perfect choice for a versatile person!",1
"Elles sont parfaites üòç J'ai pris les plus petites perles, ce qui fait tr√®s chic, et je ne les sens pas quand je dors.",1
Love these!!,1
"Attention pour les acheteurs europ√©ens, pour une commande 31‚Ç¨, taxes √† payer √† la livraison 35‚Ç¨! Abuser ! Si j'avais clairement su,... Le vendeur devrait explicitement parler du montant de la taxe de douane.",1
"Love love love.  Had a pair that lasted a couple years, and immediately bought another pair when the first broke (I‚Äôm hard on my earrings!).",1
"I love my new earrings and wear them every day!
thank you!",1
"After waiting for two months my order was delivered. I was very disappointed in the quality of the earrings! The post were bent ( look used). They were supposed to be garnet. What was sent was PINK! The only thing that could make this right is to get my money as well as my time back. Etsy if this who you do business with, then it's AMAZON for me!",1
Lovely earrings. I can't wait to gift these to my bridesmaids.,1
"Wonderful. Great quality, have not had any adverse reactions to the product. Very easy to put in and the perfect size. Large enough to see but not where its overbearing on my ear. I really love the look of the hammered silver texture on the front of the earring. 

Very easy to lose heads up!",1
"I ordered these for myself and absolutely love them !!! They are comfortable to wear ! I never wear earrings to bed because earring backs have always bothered me but I did not have an issue with these at all ! I reached out to the shop because shipping was taking a little longer than expected and they replied the same day and were extremely helpful! (Delays were due to the postal service , not the shops problem)",1
I love these earrings!! I‚Äôve had them for quite a few months and they are comfortable and very pretty. I keep getting compliments because of them. Definitely unique and good quality. I‚Äôm very happy with them and would by more in the future.,1
Love them. üòç,1
"The earing hasn't arrived yet, after my ordering of it approximately two months ago. I won't rate it, due to my inability to do so, but I will rate the shipment speed an unfortunate 1/5",1
I love this earring! I cannot wait to buy more in different colors. I didn't change out any of my cartilage piercings for many years because they were so small and difficult to manage especially because I keep my nails long. This clicker style is super easy and simple to put on and take off. Definitely would recommend!,1
"I love this! I like a very close fitting ring, so do wish it came in 7mm, but I knew the size when I ordered it, so no real complaints there. It is so cute and unique! I get compliments on it every time I wear it :)",1
"Got so many compliments on these earrings. Love them and for the price, super great!  Highly recommend",1
Not only are these really pretty and cute...but they are also the most comfortable ear climbers I have worn!! In love!,1
Love these! Very comfortable. Cute but also a little edgy! The seller is also quick! Great shop!,1
Sweet little ear climbers.  Simple and understated but the hammered finish makes them special.  Shipped very quickly.,1
"This is my second pair of these rose gold earring jackets.  I love them so much, I wanted a backup pair in case I lose one.  The color is absolutely beautiful.  They are a sleek, elegant design, and very high quality craftsmanship.  Perfect for a variety of styles and purposes.  Packaging is lovely, and shipping was really fast from UK.  A wonderful purchase!!",1
"I adore these earrings.  This particular design convinced me to try again with earrings jackets.  A bit of practice, and I love them!  They are so sophisticated and minimal, and I love the rose gold.  The craftsmanship is very high calibre.  Service is great, and delivery from UK was amazingly swift in these times.  Am purchasing another pair!",1
The earring is beautiful. I love the design and color. One thing which really surprised me was actually how light weight this earring is and how small. It really feels like you‚Äôre just wearing studs which is great.,1
Love these! Exactly as pictured and arrived promptly. Love them in sterling silver!!,1
"I LOVE !!! Beautiful earrings. resolutely modern . A highlight : the comfort ! I do not like to take off my earrings to sleep. With them no problem, you can sleep with .
The ring is almost delicate fine and can be worn alone, it fits any fingers. Very good contact with the seller who is very attentive , kind and spontaneous . A great pleasure. Thank you so much !",1
After searching high and low for this style of ear rings I finally found them . They are absolutely gorgeous understated style .,1
"These are beautiful! Very unique, and I have received many compliments on them. Only thing is that I didn‚Äôt realize the ear jacket part is a separate piece- while this is great for ensuring a good fit, it can get a little difficult to put on and I‚Äôm afraid of dropping the piece and losing it when I take them off. But I would still purchase them again despite this because they are so beautiful!",1
J‚Äôai demand√© la paire en argent et tr√®s satisfaite! Tr√®s bon service et suivi concernant mes demandes + Produit d‚Äôexce qualit√©!,1
"Seller is very responsive and offers great advice! I requested an oxidized ""black"" finish on these ear jackets, and the seller talked me through her process and gave me tips for how to polish, lighten the black, clean/care for the earrings, and more. Very impressive and kind of her! And of course the final product came out lovely with the darker finish instead of a polished silver color, they are less flashy but in a very elegant way that stands out without being obvious, so I love it. Wonderful transaction all the way, thank you so much! I chose the DHL shipping and it was lightning fast, mostly I was shocked/happy with how quickly the seller was able to create the pieces and get them to the carrier--that is service at a high level. As such I can say, buy with confidence! You will not be disappointed.",1
Absolutely gorgeous! These are some of the most strikingly beautiful earrings I've ever owned. They arrived in a very unique way too. Great communication with the seller as well. Quickly delivered.,1
These earrings are a work of art! I received many compliments when I wore them.,1
Always a pleasure to purchase from this seller! I love the earrings and I always get many compliments. The earrings are excellent quality well made and unique. The packaging includes an earring cleaner and tarnish preventing square.,1
"I L.O.V.E. these earrings! I have gotten so many compliments on them! I have super sensitive ears, but I have not had 1 problem with these earrings! I would definitely purchase again! They were quick, efficient, and the product was in great shape! Thanks!",1

"I ordered these Hammered Matte Sterling Silver and they fit my ears that have never worked with climbers before fit in 13.5mm perfectly! I'm amazed how they fit so well and I just guessed that length. I think I'm going to order them a tiny bit longer in matte, I got another pair in matte & they're gorgeous! Definitely recommend!",1
"Love my climber earrings in both gold and silver!  Delicate, but the hammered effects really refract and throw the light beautifully!
Fast shipping, too.  Thank you.  Highly recommended.",1
"On the good side. They were an absolutely adorable design! Came in a great package. Very thoughtful touches! 
Sadly, even though these are titled as being precious metal, sterling/14k (which I have worn my entire life, with no issue) in the description. They immediately irritated my ears, like lesser quality metals, always have. I tried to give them a chance, but my ears ended up so irritated, they became too painful to wear. After a few more attempts, I had to throw them away, and bought a sterling silver pair from another vendor, and have not had issues. 
Great little earrings! Just make sure you don't need proper precious metal, and you will love them!!",1
"Like someone else mentioned, I wear this in my third piercing. Fits great & very comfortable. Pretty & unique :)",1
Shipping was FAST. Very fast. My order shipped the very next day after purchase. The star ear climbers are so cute! They‚Äôre my new daily wear. And the feather charm is perfect for my charm bracelet. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è will def order again.,1
Super cute and super dainty! I‚Äôm always afraid it‚Äôs going to break though because it does get bendy very easily. Also! This was by far the fastest shipping I have received from an Etsy shop! Thank you!!,1
"I got these to put in my ""bridesmaid"" proposal boxes for my celestial themed wedding, and they're so cute!!",1

"The quality and detail in craftsmanship are impeccable! I got this as a gift for my wife after hearing about earring jackets on the radio. She has 1 carat studs, and these jackets are a good balance for the stone size. Thank you for she speedy processing and shipping.",1
"These earring jackets took plain gemstone post earrings to an all new level. Easy to attach to the post, and stays securely on. The quality of the earring jacket is very good.",1

"Perfect in every way! Beautifully made earrings. Perfect for everyday wear, love them!",1
Love theese so very pretty,1
"I love this simple ear climber. It‚Äôs my first and I had no idea if I‚Äôd even like them. It‚Äôs simple, delicate, and a subtle different and exciting piece of jewelry to switch things up. Also, gold filled is the best option!

And, the small details when I received my package was such a pleasant surprise. This is why I love shopping local!",1
"Wow, this is my first pair of climbers and I love them!! They are so dainty and beautiful while being ever so slightly edgy. They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. 
I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!",1

Very dainty ear climber - it‚Äôs hard to tell from the photo but it‚Äôs very slim and subtle. Love it !,1

"Quality is great! I got the rose gold and loved my pick, the picture is accurate! Love my new earrings üòÑüòÑüòÑ",1
Absolutely beautiful and go from day to night effortlessly. I ordered the brass and the quality is wonderful. I hadn't anticipated it but there are at least 3 different ways to combine the pieces and wear the studs. Love!,1
Absolutely gorgeous earrings! Bought for my sister for Christmas. The rose gold is perfection. Very quick shipping and really well presented. Would definitely buy from this shop again!,1
Such beautiful timeless handcrafted jewelry! I can take the back piece off for a more casual everyday look or put it back on when I dress up! LOVE them and have gotten so many compliments!!,1
"I paired this with a Catbird NYC Sweet Nothing chain. It's the perfect mix of sparkle and understated. The size of the moonstone is small, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm in love with it; might buy an emerald one, too!",1
"I think these earrings are now the prettiest thing I own. I love them so much. Super fast delivery, too. Thank you so much, Laine!",1
"I absolutely love this ring. Beautiful heavy, thick sterling ring. I actually call it a family ring, with my birthstone first, then my 3 children's birthstones and then my grandchildren birthstones, as they came along in my life. Handmade and beautifully done.  Thank you so much, Laine, I worship this üíç",1
"I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size).""  I was looking for a small pendant with turquoise but not that small. I found LaineBenthallDesigns and thought I'd give it a try. I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece. The only time I will remove it is to clean it!",1
"I purchased a pair in silver, & loved them so much, I just bought the gold!  What a wonderful, chic way to experiment with multiple piercings without the commitment!  Stays comfortably on my ear, & I‚Äôve received so many compliments!  ü•∞",1
"Sheri fabricated these earrings custom based on my wild requests. She did a Beautiful Job. I could not be more satisfied. The cuffs are gorgeous, and great quality. I get the look of having 5 piercings with just One ear hole! Incredible!",1
"Thank you Sheri. I received  my earrings today, and they are absolutely beautiful! They catch the light just so and they also have a nice weight to it. I  would give them a 6 star if there was one more star available. They are amazing!! I would recommend these earrings and this seller without hesitation.",1
"They are gorgeous! Given  THE Pandemic- I thought they shipped and arrived very fast.....I‚Äôm glad ‚ÄúI Sprung‚Äù for them-should have done sooner-LIFE IS SHORT-GET THE EARRINGS! Jeez, I do really like them! Great service ,  great quality and design.

Thanks -

"Lovely little ear climbers, arrived really quickly!",1
"Another winner, thank you. Much admired.",1
I love these earrings.  Very pretty and stylish.,1
"Absolutely in love with this nose ring. It‚Äôs my favorite piece. I was worried about the sizing since everybody‚Äôs nose shape and size is different but it fit mine perfectly. I wore it all the time. Unfortunately, with having to wear face masks, I accidently lost it when I took off my face mask. Eventually planning on getting a new one.",1
"I love my tourmaline vine ring. I get so many compliments on it. Great quality, communication and shipping! Thank you!",1
It came so fast and it‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL!  I‚Äôm autistic so it really helps me with being able to stim in public without it being too ‚Äúovert‚Äù. I bought one last year from their Amazon site but since it doesn‚Äôt fit anymore I decided to get another one through Etsy. As soon as I saw they restocked I bought one and it got here in 3 days. The spinner rings are perfect and not too big which was something I was worried about. Overall I‚Äôm super happy with it and definitely recommend!!,1
REALLY amazing piece! Eye catching and convertible to single stud. Excellent craftsmanship too- very secure but adjustable for different shaped ear lobes.,1
These took quite awhile to arrive - 17 days - but they are here now and I love them. For my smaller earlobes they are perfect - stud earrings in only one piece and the curved end doesn't show at all. I'll wear them often. Thank you!,1
Great earrings!,1

Absolutely love these earrings! Beautiful!,1
these are so awesome thank you,1
"Beautiful! Arrived promptly, and well-packed (it's fragile)!",1
I was so excited to receive this & finally did. Packaging is cute enough & they write that they are excited and expecting to read a positive review online w/a very thick marker that isn't the easiest to read. I love the look of these earrings but they won't stay put/stay in place in one ear so will be returning.,1
These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I love them! They fit nice and snug and I have had no problems with them slipping down. Shipping was super fast. Excellent work!,1
This was a great purchase! Absolutely love simple elegancy this brings to an outfit!,1
"I love the ear climbers, very delicate and look very nice on. They also arrived quicker than I expected. I am very pleased with this purchase!",1
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures.",1
"These earrings arrived quickly, were packaged well, and are beautiful. The craftsmanship is excellent and they look/feel heavy without feeling heavy on my ears. I love the little ‚Äúclip‚Äù at the top to ensure they stay in place. They are exactly what I was looking for and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them...they will be showstoppers. Can‚Äôt wait to order more from Rebeka Jewelry.",1
"These are so gorgeous, I can't wait to wear them for my wedding this summer. The shipping was SO fast! Looking forward to placing a future order!",1
I bought these for my daughter for her wedding. They're so much prettier in person. They were shipped and delivered very quickly.,1
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!,1
"Absolutely beautiful earring! Perfect fit for my conch. The quality is beyond superb. My package arrived, stateside, so fast and was wrapped beautifully. Thank you so much for the amazing jewelry. I would absolutely purchase from Rosec, again. Photos to follow!",1
Gorgeous EARRINGS! I received so many compliments for them. Super fast shipping as well.,1
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful.",1
"Sandra answered all of my questions and the shipping from Turkey was quick. I have very small ears (for reference the hoops in my first lobe are 10 mm) so I was worried the Gemini stud would be too big and my third lobe piercing is also very low so it‚Äôs been hard to find jewellery that doesn‚Äôt accentuate that. I‚Äôm also allergic to so many metals. I‚Äôm so thankful to have found this one! My sign, Gemini, is symmetrical and the post is on one end so flipped upside down it‚Äôs perfect. But even though it's a 6mm post, it's loose enough to flip over on its own and you do need to adjust it throughout the day. The backing is also pretty and I could wear it backwards too. Just be aware it is hard to thread if you have long nails and hair/clothes do catch easily on the front of the stud.",1
"I‚Äôm in Pennsylvania, shipping was fast considering it came from Europe. Seller reached out, informed me it was shipped, great communication. I purchased 8mm evil eye for the top of my ear. I can only wear real gold, otherwise that piercing gets irritated. I love love the flat back!! It doesn‚Äôt poke the back of my ear like standard backs. It‚Äôs a little tricky to get in, struggled with it, used tweezers, but once in..it‚Äôs secure and very comfortable..in addition it‚Äôs well made and looks great. I‚Äôm very happy with it! Highly recommend!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",1
This is the perfect piece! It came swiftly for being international and I could tell the seller put a lot of care into the packaging. The ring itself is high quality and has been perfect for my conch piercing. It‚Äôs been very secure has stayed beautiful. It‚Äôs exactly what I imagined it would be.,1
As expected it took forever to get here but it was so worth the wait. Such a beautiful piece! I'm never taking it off. thank you!,1
so many compliments on this dainty yet outspoken piece of jewelry.  I wear a mohawk and need something loud but delicate to preserve some femininity.  These are perfect.,1
i love it!! the prettiest little details :) thanks so much x,1
"I have TINY hands, so I was really worried this wouldn‚Äôt fit, but you can easily bend the ring, where the snake curves to fit your finger perfectly. I got the darker colored piece - quality is spectacular. I‚Äôm so excited to where it everyday! Thank you!!",1
"Very elegant Earrings, exactly as pictured.  Truly something else. Im very happy with them. Gonna probably order some for my friend as well, since she likes them a lot too. Thank you also for fast shipping and very good wrapping.",1
love it ! very fashionable !,1
"I would wear this pair of earrings all the time, all day long if it were solid gold. Got compliments all the time, very well made. Beautiful item! I love it! Received much earlier than promised - in short, highly recommend this seller. No worries, you will be happy with your purchase. I will definitely buy again from this seller.",1
TOP! Really nice artistic design. Accentuates the shape of the earlobe (two fitting points - so adjustable to different ear sizes) and curves nicely around it. Would definitely buy again. :-D,1
Loved wearing these on my wedding day!,1
"Absolutely love my feather bracelet! It‚Äôs actually my second one. After losing the first one on my wedding night, I was so grateful to hear back from Gazellejewelry. They made me another one. It fits perfect and I get so many compliments. 
I will definitely be ordering from this shop again!",1
"I bought these for a friend and had them shipped directly to her so I didn't see them in person, however my friend absolutely loves them and couldn't stop raving about them!",1
"So happy I purchased these!!! I'd been in search for wedding earrings for a while and kept coming back to these. I finally purchased them, a little late so I had to express ship them but the seller was very friendly and helpful and the earrings are BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 recommend!",1
These were absolutely perfect in my wedding day. They were well made and shipped quickly. I couldn‚Äôt be happier!,1
"The pieces I ordered were absolutely beautiful and you could tell Marina spent much time and effort in making quality products. I love them and would definitely purchase again. Even better was Marina's customer service, which is one of the best I've experienced. She's not only prompt in answering messages, but works with you if you have special needs or requests, going above and beyond to make sure you're satisfied. Thanks again Marina, I'd give you even more stars if I could!",1
So beautiful! I get a million compliments every time I wear these. Such a lovely seller as well-super communicative and just a delight.,1
"Fabulous design.  Simple, yet edgy, and beautifully made.  They look great with my new short haircut.  Lovely correspondence with Marina, and received quickly from overseas.  Thank you!",1
"My husband bought me these earrings for my birthday. I absolutely love them and always get complimented on them when I wear them. Unfortunately whilst getting ready for a 10k run, the back flew off and I lost one earjacket in the middle of a field. I contacted Kat and she made me a new ear jacket to match my remaining one. Such brilliant service and delivered quickly. Thank you Kat. I will definitely be purchasing more items in the future.",1

"Love this item, and the sellers. They worked with me to find exactly the right material for my cuff, as I'll be wearing it for my wedding. It arrived exactly when they said it would, and looks even better than the pictures! Very happy with this cuff!",1
"Very pretty necklace! It is well made, shipped promptly, and the seller even included a little charm with my initial on it! 

My one critique is that the necklace chain is too long, especially for the size of the pendant, but it is easy to adjust the butted ring and clip the chain.",1
"Love my ear crawlers!  Beautiful craftsmanship!  Shipped fast!  Definitely will buy more sets. Just back from NGO work in Kenya, where sadly I lost my left beautiful climber.  Have just reordered a new leftie.  Can‚Äôt stand to be without a complete set!",1

"Absolutely love these earrings. I haven't taken them out since the day I got them in the mail. Very comfortable to wear and they're low-key, but I still do get compliments on them. Great experience buying them too! They arrived just in time for the day I originally needed them.",1
I really like the ear pin! Thank you! It brings out my heritage.,1
Loved it! Classy and beautiful!,1

"Wow super fast shipping! I ordered these ear pins on a Thursday & got them the following Monday. I like how these ear pins don't look ""crafty"" like most of the listings for ear pins do. These pins look like high quality store sold earrings. Will definitely purchase from this shop again.",1
"I absolutely love these crawlers!!! I had recently received a set in a subscription box and unfortunately they were plated metal. Turned my ears green/black. I had been looking all over locally without luck for this particular style crawler and then it hit me to check Etsy!

I certainly can foresee future purchases and have been spreading the word. 
Thanks again, 
Sarah T",1
"Love these! Very solid build, no tarnish and have been wearing them for a few months solid now. Always get lots of compliments and people asking where I got them. Light and comfortable - don‚Äôt even notice I‚Äôm wearing them. Great for wearing around babies with grabbing little hands! Haha :)",1
Super cute and chic! Super excited to where these out! Love love love them! The color is amazing and they fit so perfectly on my ear it feels like I'm not even wearing anything,1
Item is just as pictured! Just lovely. I did the free shipping to the US so it took awhile but I was offered faster shipping but would have to pay. So I decided to wait. Earrings are delicate and slightly smaller than I wanted but still wonderful! Would buy again.,1
These were absolutely beautiful and totally exceeded my expectations. Not only was the packaging so incredibly thoughtful and well presented but the earrings are actually like little works of art . Cannot recommend these guys enough and will definitely buy from them again! Thank you so much x x x,1
The earrings are really pretty! And it got here a lot faster than I expected.,1
"Simply fantastic, very beautiful turquoise color, light and elegant. Perfect",1

Perfect fit! I‚Äôm wearing a 4 1/2. I‚Äôm definitely going to buy a few more! It‚Äôs a comfortable knuckle ring which has been hard to find for me! It‚Äôs the perfect dainty ring I highly recommend. Shipping was fast as well! Super happy with my purchase!,1

"Absolutely beautiful! I got these to stack with some other hexagon rings I have, and I love how they add some character to my stack or is a simple statement of its own!",1

Always the best quality as well!
Thank you!",1
Looks great and have been able to wear comfortably - no sensitivity at all!,1
Love love love these earrings! Beautifully made good quality. I wear mine as a climber and it looks great.,1
Love these earrings ‚ù£Ô∏è,1
I really love it! For my tiny ears it probably would be better if both arrows were a little bit smaller. The dimensions between lobe holes is perfect but they are a little long for my small ear. But that just means I may need to order more in a custom size üòâ truly love them!,1
I paid for gift wrap and I was so impressed! My mum loves them and the wrapping. Especially how eco friendly it was! I had to stop her from opening them a day early. Thank you so much. Also your handwriting is beautiful!,1

"Beautiful earring, absolutely stunning!
Took me a while to figure out how to get it in but it looks absolutely fantastic and I love it!
Unfortunately it does not stay in place. Since it rests on the cheek, it moves along with its movement. So it needs frequent checking, I'm afraid otherwise its going to slip out.",1
Super cool earrings!  Light and easy to wear...oh yeah..and very chic!,1
"These earrings are absolutely great, I get compliments all the time",1
Exactly what I thought they would be and I love wearing them!,1

I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase.  Thank you so very, very much.  üíúü•∞üíú",1
These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They are high quality and exactly what I wanted. They arrived quicker than I expected. I highly recommend this artist.,1
"They look lovely, exactly t as I was looking for! Thin and seems to be fragile earrings, very delicate look.  Easy to adjust the hook so they fit better.",1
"My daughter loves these.
She wears them all the time.
So much detail on them, absolutely stunning.",1
Pretty silver wing ear climbers. Took some time to be delivered from Greece to Sydney Australia (understandably!). Easy to put on.,1
"It took forever to get here, but they are absolutely gorgeous! Worth the wait.  I ordered a similar pair from LuxandLuster and the earrings were awful and so was the customer service.  Order from these guys if you can wait a few weeks....you won't be disappointed!  Their jewelry is beautiful and very comfortable!",1
"I bought two pairs of hoops, I have worn them every day since I got them and absolutely love them! I have thin hair and was worried my hair would get caught in the hoops but that didn‚Äôt happen. 

I was sent a generic tracking number, the dates were from October and I purchased these in February. The seller got back to me write away, explained she was in a different country and sent me new tracking information. She was SO kind! I would purchase jewelry from her again!",1
Love these gold leaf ear climbers. They're beautifully made and affordable. They're relatively easy to hook into your ear. Took a while to be delivered - understandably as they came from Europe. Can't wait to wear them out.,1
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus",1
Amazing earrings....I love them!  They are simply gorgeous and I cannot say enough about them.  Excellent quality and so very unique.  I cannot wait to show them off at an upcoming event I am attending....Fast shipping and fab convo with seller.  Highly recommended!!!,1
They are much more beautiful than the photo! I wore them right away to dinner and the server said they were so unique & sparkly. I will visit your shop again Vicki!!  Thank you!,1
"Arrived perfectly and beautifully wrapped with many packaging details. The earrings are stunning, my girlfriend has been wanting them for months and she's over the moon. Thank you, you are gifted!",1
"Amazing availability, amazing and perfect object! I recommend it to all! Alessandro.",1
I ordered these as a present for my friend and she absolutely loves them! They look gorgeous - thank you!,1
These were beautiful. I cant wait to give them to my bridesmaids as gifts!,1
"Iv not got round to trying these on yet,their smaller than expected but still cute",1
My wife was over the moon!!,1
Absolutely love these! They're very good quality and heavier than expected (in a good way!) great seller too,1
Gold studs tarnished on first cleaning. Jackets are great quality. I get compliments all the time!,1
"Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality.

Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them.",1
"So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too! Feels sturdy, and can be secured by positioning the climber to desired spot then squeezing both sides closed. I thought it might be too big for my small ears andI'm glad I took the risk cause it paid off. Love the fact it's adjustable! Love the packaging too (tiny test tube securely wrapped in bubble wrap) and the silver-care instructions.",1
People always ask me where I got these earrings when I wear them.  I've gotten people hooked on Etsy by wearing these.  Definitely a conversation piece!,1
"Love these earrings and get lots of comments about them! 
Production and shipping were as specified, and it was great to be able to track them online once shipped.  They were a little fiddly at the start, but once I got used to them i have no problem now putting them in and taking them out. Definitely recommend them!!",1
Love these so much!!! I lost one and will be ordering another 2 pair just in case I lose any in the future. That's how much I love these!!!,1
"i love these earrings, pictures don't do them justice, they feel like a solid piece of jewelry, heavy and effective",1

"Great design, as beautiful as expected :)",1
Beautiful and delicate earrings!,1
I get compliments all the time! Obsessed :),1
Love it! Quality was there as well.,1
"These earrings are lovely, and great for the price! I love rose gold and these are so delicate. They shipped to me quickly and I had them in my hands a few days after ordering. Only advice is don't bend and unbend the back too much, as it's very flexible and could break off. But that shouldn't happen if you're just wearing it normally in your ear lobe.",1
I looooove this product. The earrings are beautiful and so dainty!!,1
LOVE!! So perfect for my wedding!!,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! So cute. The seller was great and responded quickly. Would definitely buy from again.,1
These are amazing and great quality love that theyres adjustments for the earring would buy from again!!! I literally get so many compliments,1
I got these to pair along with the little hoops with the same triangular ball arrangement. They look so cute together. These earrings are beautiful!,1
"So pretty and delicate! You can also take off the jacket part and just have studs if you want even more of a minimalist look sometimes. They were delivered earlier than I was expecting, so that was great. 10/10 recommend.",1
"I couldn't love these earrings any more! I bought them for my co-worker and I as we work at a Fertility Clinic. Needless to say, they are a favourite amongst patients and staff. Very well made, super original, and fast shipping!!",1
"Great item, exactly as described!  Thanks a lot!",1
Absolutely beautiful!,1
Look fab and fitted well  üíï,1
Got to adjust to stay in place. Got to bend to stay as in the pictures,1
"Arrived right on time, so beautiful and the cutest packaging!! Love it",1
I absolutely love this product! The delivery was great - it even arrived earlier than expected! The earring is perfect  and fits nicely. It's easy to put in and is comfortable to wear. The design is beautiful and is wonderfully made.  I strongly recommend getting this if it's something you would want.,1
I love this so much! I definitely recommend it to everyone. ‚öîÔ∏è‚ú®,1
Cannot review yet as I have not received it. Ordered on April 24. Today is May 26 and all tracking shows is that it left Singapore on May 18. Originally from Philippines. I will leave a review once I receive it. (Hopefully) If you need it for a gift you better order at least 2 months ahead! I wanted it for my granddaughter. I won't be able to give it to her tomorrow as part of 8th grade graduation gift üôÅ,1
Very happy with my 2.1 mm 16 in. Paper clip chain. Arrived quickly. Layered here with a 17in necklace.,1
Its beautiful! With the length and size I ordered its perfect for everyday wear without it being over the top!,1
"Exactly as promised, this 4.6mm X 24 inch 10K solid gold Figaro chain was delivered in a timely manner by USPS.  The purchase amount was lower than I've seen elsewhere, so I consider this durable, easy-to-wear chain a very good value - costing hundreds instead of thousands.  Thanks!  
- Perfect size for pendants.",1
"Well-crafted work, by which this gold link chain will be among my favorites! ... and just as awesome, I've purchased the matching bracelet as well.  All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase(s) and plan to be a regular customer from here/on.",1

"Very beautiful design. But, the color is not as the bright yellow as the picture showed.",1
"So beautiful! I was impressed when I opened the lovely box to see those 2 very delicate ear climbers. I was afraid it would be too big or not delicate enough when I ordered it, it's not. It's just perfect, beautifully made.
The shipping was very fast and carefully made. Charlie was very nice. I will definitly follow this shop and look up for new items soon.",1

beautiful craftsmanship!  will purchase from this designer again.,1
"I was looking for a ring exactly like this for my daughter and me. I did want the design modified a little bit. The jeweler was very prompt, accommodating and responsive.  I sent photos of what I wanted and the changes were done perfectly! I bought the ring in 2 sizes and 2 gold colors (yellow and white gold).  Everything about the process was 5 star. The quality is impeccable. The service was exemplary. The design is simple, beautiful and exactly what I wanted! I was initially nervous when I learned the jeweler was not in the US, but my concern was wasted energy as the product and shipping was exactly on time with no issues. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised, as the rings arrived in individual ring boxes which had a small light illuminate on the ring upon opening. Without question, I would purchase from this jeweler, again.",1
WAYYYYY nicer then the pictures gave it credit for!!! One of the most GORGEOUS rings I‚Äôve ever seen!!! My fianc√© and I thank the company so much it‚Äôs so amazing üòµüíïüëçüèº,1

I received the pearl ear climbers  and very please with the craftsmanship. They are also known as ear pins. This pair has a modest and feminine characteristics about them which I will enjoy wearing. Not heavy on the ear lobe and the pin tread through the lobe is not to wide if you have a thick ear lobe.,1

"Finally! I got the ring and it‚Äôs so pretty! The color is not as vibrant as in the picture‚Ä¶ a more pale pink. I got it in silver because I was afraid the gold plated would fade with time. The seller was very quick to reply to my inquiries. The shipping was slow (international shipping, from Greece to the USA). Even thou the seller provided the shipping tracking number, I wasn‚Äôt able to track it. I relied on the Etsy app telling me I could leave a review on Wednesday (today) and I received the ring on Monday. It took around 3 weeks from the day I ordered to the day it was delivered. So keep in mind the shipping times if you need the ring within a certain date.",1
So beautiful. Simple but make a statement of beauty. The price is perfect. It did take a while to get to me with the covid and the fact they had to be shipped to the U.S. from Israel. But for sure worth the wait for such reasonably priced earrings!,1
"Bought these as a present for my sister's birthday. They are even more beautiful and intricate in person, she loved them!

Finally- I have a ring that I can wear all the time without the worry of it turning my finger green! I‚Äôm surprised it was done so quickly, too! It came all the way from France to California, & it got her a lot faster than I thought, also! Mew has been my favorite ever since I was a little girl, ever since I can remember actually! I use to carry a Mew plushie all over the place when I was 3. I still have that plush as well~! I LOVE how he used her tail for the part that wraps around your finger. That‚Äôs so incredibly artistic. My mom thinks the same thing! The packaging it came in was really cute too. It came in a little pouch, & was very well packaged so nothing would happen to it. Thank you!",1
"Beautiful and stunning ring! The craftmanship Is amazing! 
Also super Friendly contact. I had some trouble with finding my ring size and the seller was really supportive! I‚Äòm totally in love with My item and will definetely buy again ‚ù§Ô∏è.",1

I will never take this ring off, I'm in love with it. I will 100% buy again from this shop and recommend to everyone I know.",1
"I have been playing so much mario lately and links awakening so i wanted to get some cute chain chomps of my own!! so i did, these are great! in love thank you",1

"Very pretty, they fit the edge of my ears nicely - not too long or  wide.",1
"This is such a nice piece of jewelry! I was concerned that it might be too large for my small ear lobes, but it adjusts easily. It has just the right amount of sparkle to draw the eye, but it's not too big.",1
Mom loved it!! Affordable and still super cute. Sorry I can‚Äôt say more because these weren‚Äôt for me.,1
These are lovely! They sparkle so much! Perfect !,1

Beautiful piece and I can‚Äôt wait to add more to my collection.,1
Beautiful and unique!!,1

These earrings are gorgeous -- my daughter absolutely loved them!,1
These earrings are gorgeous! They look even better in person than they do in the photos. I love that the back piece has several holes so you can adjust the earring to better fit your ear length. Very pleased with this purchase!,1
These earrings are GORGEOUS and so sparkly. I ordered the rose gold color and got so many compliments on my wedding day. Everyone loved them and I am so happy they are trendy enough to rewear.,1

Beautiful work !",1
Very cute earrings! Arrived timely and carefully packages.,1
Excuse the snap chat filter! I just love these!!! They don‚Äôt take away from my diamond studs and they are just the perfect thing I‚Äôve been looking for! Stunning!! Couldn‚Äôt be happier!!,1
"I love the design! It's relatively hard to find beautifully designed & made hypoallergenic earrings, so I'm very happy with these. Highly recommended!",1
Love the earrings!  The metal is perfect - light but strong.  Would definitely buy from again.,1
The earrings are so pretty and they came with extra backs which is always nice. The backs are nice and secure too.,1
"Amazing earrings,  simple but elegant! Lightweight and comfortable,  I'm already wearing them! Thank you!!!",1
"I own many septum rings and this is now my favorite one of them all. It's an absolute masterpiece - everything I was looking for in a ring. It's detailed, textured, and the gold color is beautiful. It's easy to put in and shipping was very quick for my location. Don't hesitate to buy this ring.",1
Love my ring. I wear it as a midi ring and it looks so cute! Shipping was rather quick. Very satisfied!,1
Beautiful earrings! I had mine made as studs and with silver and there were no issues. They are gorgeous and comfy to wear. I paid for express shipping and they arrived (in Australia!) very quickly.  I look forward to wearing them for my university graduation in May. Would order again!,1
Ordered these & a matching hair comb for my wedding to go with a sash I‚Äôd bought separately & they‚Äôre gorgeous!!,1
This seller is so easy to work with. She was responsive to all my questions and worked me on a few things so I could get a perfect pair of earrings that had stones that went with the stones on the belt that was on the dress I wore for my daughter‚Äôs wedding. These  earrings matched perfectly.  I received many compliments on them. Thank you Rebeka!,1
"I ordered some nude, blush drop earrings. They took about 3 weeks to arrive, but that was expected. I loved the way they looked in the picture, and they are way prettier in person! I was pleasantly surprised!",1
They are beautiful in person! Just what I was looking for a dainty ear climber. I love them,1
"I've never used Ear Climber Earrings before. But I absolutely love these. The are dainty and perfect for my big day. 

Thank you!",1
"Absolutely gorgeous, dainty, and classy!  These climbers are very lightweight and stay in place with the backings.  FYI, they are not interchangeable from left to right ear, so you have to make sure they are in right!  I'd say the only downside to these is that you can't sleep in them.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! Thanks.",1
"Seller has excellent communication, and the shipping was VERY quick THANK YOU!!!!!! Earrings are super dainty and the perfect size to appear classy. They're a bit sparklier in the photo than in person, but very pretty.",1
They are so pretty! I love them.,1
"Took me forever to find a seller who makes this type of clamp without chains, beads, etc. attached to the clamps but these are perfect! The mass amount of searching was worth it as these are exactly what I was looking for and when I recieved the two clamps I ordered, it turns out the quality is wonderful as well! Can't wait to surprise my Sir with these the next time I see him! He's going to love them for sure!",1
"It's so beautiful in person. Very dainty, but still good quality. Looks great when you're sitting or lying down and it's placed just right (like seen in the picture of the offer). It came in a very cute jewellery box and that is also where I will keep it when I am not wearing it!

Personally i prefered it less dangly and so i got rid of the chain <.< Easily done, looks great. As I said it's a personal preference and the article is everything it promises to be!",1
So here it goes - the wait was excruciating. It took forever but boy was it worth it! They are beautiful. I am truly in love with them and as greedy as my nature is I will be coming back for more! There is still lapis and sweet turquoises to be had!,1
"I love this idea, it's a very pretty look. 
Thank you!!",1
"I'd be glad  to review it if it were not still away across the country in Montreal, according to the tracking report.  It's been stuck there a long  time, so I hope somebody can get the package moving again.

The package has arrived, and I'm delighted.  It's especially useful to have the included little jar to keep the silver safe from tarnish.  Thanks!",1
"I loved the packaging! The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give five stars was that the stones weren‚Äôt as brilliant as the picture depicted. After I shined the ear climbers throughly it looked a lot better. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase!",1
"These are so pretty!!Very well made.The hammers look is Awsome.I wore them out,and got so many compliments on them.I have two holes in my ears,so I can wear them either in the first..alone or in the second,with gold or diamond earings.Very pleased üòÄ",1
Ear Climber was exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!,1
Beautiful!,1
"I am in love with these ear crawlers!  They are very high quality, especially for how little they cost.  Super pleased with this purchase, will buy from this seller again!",1
Received! and I love them. Simple well made with a nice snug fit (you can pinch the backing to make it fit snugly). Seller was thoroughly responsive when the first shipment never arrived and was most likely lost by the post office. She worked with me and sent another quickly. Will def shop with this seller again. Thank you!,1

"Very pretty and well shipped. Please turned out to be a little bit too long for my ears, keeping them anyway since they are lovely.",1
"Beautiful, delicate looking, yet well made. When I wore it the first time, even my husband noticed and thought they were beautiful. Customer service was stellar (my questions regarding the earrings were answered promptly, the earrings were dispatched on time).  My personal style trend towards a more classic look.  However, I noted a variety of styles for various ages and fashion sense displayed in her store. So I bought a few more pieces as Christmas gifts for my mom in law, sister and daughters and snuck another earring climber in for myself!",1
I received these earring along with a ring. I wanted to wait to wear them to give an honest review and I can honestly say I LOVE them both. These earrings have become part of my everyday wear. Great quality. They shine beautifully. The shipping was quick and it was packaged very well. I look fort to bring a faithful customer. I highly recommend you purchase here !,1
"Very sparkly and delicate, will look great on my wedding day. Shipped super fast and good price for such nice quality.",1
"wow! this ring is beautiful and came way sooner than expected! it came in the cutest macaron container and opening it was like unboxing a mini tiara for my finger. i love all the details in the filigree and the wrapped wire look towards the top. the moonstone gives off cloudy blue and yellow tints adding to its mystic powers. the seller replied very quickly before i made the purchase as well as addressing my concerns with the ring in transit, and was very understanding and aligned with me. 10/10 would shop again! thank you so much<33!!",1
I love this ring and have already gotten so many compliments! It is a stand out ring that is so unique in its design I just couldn‚Äôt pass it up and I‚Äôm so glad I have it!,1
It's easy adjustable and the quality is amazing. It looks really cute and the ring isn't heavy at all! Would def. recommend.,1
"Omg, the ring is beautiful! And it fits perfectly ü•∞",1
"My favorite part about these earrings is how easy they are to just slide on! And I‚Äôm never worried about losing one because they really stay put, even without a back. Plus they look AWESOME!",1
"These earring look just as pictured, they are good quality and they arrived on time. My only slight critique, is that they fit a little tight. But I think I can adjust that myself easily! So all in all good!",1
I love the earring! Very unique. I‚Äôve already had people asking about it. üíô,1
gorgeous! love the earring! its very elegant and came super fast in mail!,1
"I bought a pair of these, loved them so much the posts broke!!! In like, 2 days. BUT Evelyn was so generous, asked that I send them back so she can see, and she made a brand-new pair free-of-charge. Each time, she included a handwritten note which made it so personal. I felt like I was just buying lovely stuff from a friend! DO buy these earrings, they're so delicate and beautiful. Just a friendly tip, though, be sure not to bend the hooks too far out so the earrings will last a little longer. I was not so graceful the first time around but will be going forward. THANK YOU, EVELYN!!",1
"Absolutely beautiful earring! Definitely came much quicker than the 2-3 weeks that it originally stated in the listing. I needed as a helix earring to replace a broken one I had been wearing, saw this earclimber and absolutely fell in love with the design. I wanted the earring to climb ""down"" instead of up, so I though it would be good to purchase the opposing ear (left earring for right ear). I messaged Evelyn and she was kind enough to give me many angles of the earring including measurements to make sure I felt like I was making the right decision. I definitely think I did! The earring came in a beautiful box with a nice gift bag and polishing cloth if you want to gift it.",1
I love my earrings! It is well designed. I needed stylish stud earrings that my baby won‚Äôt be able to pull down. These are perfect.,1
"un gioiello unico, confortevole e molto elegante. avevo il dubbio potesse scivolare verso il basso e invece rimane fermo per tutto il giorno! sono molto soddisfatta del mio acquisto, me ne ero immediatamente innamorata e non sono rimasta affatto delusa, l'attesa del suo arrivo √® stata ampiamente ripagata! grazie!",1
"I wore these in gold for my wedding day and absolutely loved them. The earrings are a perfect size, high quality, and just as pictured. Thank you!",1

"Not only is this a VERY talented artist, she is also a super sweet lady! I am already a repeat customer and will be back. Beautiful, well made jewelry at an awesome price... How can you go wrong? Thank you SO much!!!!",1
Again my wife loves these earrings. Thank you.,1
"BEYOND AWESOME!  Lovely customer service, lightening attention on a custom order, lovely packaging.  Wowee!  My custom extra long bar earring is glorious.  I wanted an earring like the one a character in John Wick wore (don‚Äôt judge).  This is perfect.  I feel so cool, and the craftsmanship is stellar.  Lightweight, dramatic, perfecto!!",1
Kathleen from Macalania has to be one of the kindest shop managers on all of Etsy! I had experienced shipping delays due to COVID which was not her fault at all and she made sure to send out a second pair of earrings so that they would arrive in time for a gift. She consistently tracked and updated my order to make sure I felt reassured the entire time. Her generosity and kindness went above and beyond! The earrings are GORGEOUS they are delicate and shined to perfection and I love so much that they are a gold and silver color which will allow me to match with all my other jewelry. They are amazingly minimal and make the perfect gift for all your designer friends!! I cannot thank her enough for this beautiful gift and I cannot wait to buy from this shop again! Thank you thank you ‚ú®‚ú® And they were shipped with extra backings!,1
"This has been by far one of my best purchases on Etsy. The earring itself is beautifully crafted, with a pearl which is elegant and perfectly sized. I was pleasantly surprised with the earring's weight as well. I expected it to be significantly heavier but in truth I barely notice that I have it on. The shop's owner responds fast, is extremely easy to communicate with, very friendly and puts a lot of care into packaging and posting her jewelry. She even included a beautiful necklace as a gift! Great shop, great owner, will definitely come back for more!",1
"Beautiful, I love it! Maybe the bar of the moon is a bit long for me and tend to hurt a little. But it is worth it ;)",1
"Bought these for my girlfriend. Shipped perfectly on time to Canada. She absolutely loves them, super unique. She likes that you can wear the pearls by themselves and add the moons for going out at night.",1
These are beautiful and they came on time as the seller guaranteed! Thanks so much ^_^,1
"Absolutely perfect, love these, they look beautiful!",1
"Very pretty and dainty. Not overwhelmingly punk but still punk enough if you have to go to work and still want to do you. The ball post studs are shorter than all my other studs, so they do fit a bit snug, so I am using them with my other posts. They look good with everything.",1
"Absolutely amazing, thank you so much for this beautiful ear studs!!! Regards from Austria ?",1
I love my gold spike earring jackets that go on the backside of the ear. Subtle but stylish.,1
Very pretty!,1
"These came so quick and I absolutely love them, great quality for a cheap price",1
They are beautiful to wear. They sit so well on the ear. thankyou,1
"Excellent quality item, prompt communication, amazing service, express postage",1
"Super cool earrings! Very unique, very chic, and subtle, but interesting.The hoop part was a bit thinner than I thought it would be, but no matter, these are still cool earrings! Great for every day. Quick shipping was a plus! Thank you so much",1
Unique.  Quick shipping.  Smaller than they look photo but still great.,1
"I love them so much! Wearing them everyday! Super comfy, perfect packaging! and great customer service!",1
The earrings are very delicate and beautiful. The quality is excellent and I love them!!,1
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!",1
Like everything I have bought the picture does not do it justice! Super cute and quirky! Could not recommend urban raven enough! Gorgeous individual pieces and I am totally obsessed!!,1
I can't say enough about this necklace!  This necklace is everything and more!  Fits perfectly and goes with everything I wear! I was shocked how quickly the item arrived considering it was international!  The fact that it's one of a kind and was upcycled is so beautiful!  I am also so partial to butterflies as my oldest daughter's name -- Vanessa actually means butterfly so it has an extra special meaning to me!  Thank you so much for your quality work and excellent customer service! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)",1
Very pretty! I prefer this style because of the bigger hook. I've gotten some that hurt my ear so bad but this one is a little bigger and fits great with no pain. I'm going to get a few more of the other styles. Thank you!!!,1
"This ring is even more beautiful in person! The Onyx stone is done and placed beautifully, the design had minuscule imperfections which gives it character.

Shipping was concerning. For me it disclosed that the printing label was created but no information of tracking (for those who obsessively check aka ME). But it did arrive within 2-3 weeks which was expected for a made to order product.",1
Amazing ring. My husband loves it. Beautiful quality and attention to detail. The engraving was perfect. Great customer service. Highly recommend this Etsy shop. Very satisfied with the whole process and product. Thank you.,1
"I‚Äôve bought about a dozen rings from Roar and they‚Äôre all fabulous but labradorite is a favorite of mine so the ring really appealed to me. Beyond that, I think the setting is gorgeous!",1

"A beautiful piece of jewelry, excellently delivered. Great service and care by the shop owner.",1
"A really beautiful ring, arrived quickly, and happy with the seller.  I've had this ring for a little while now (5 months), and I'm still obsessed with it. There are quite some scratches already, but that may be due to my carelessness. When ordering the seller confirmed my ring size with me and it fits perfectly. I got it in white gold, but the pictures don't do it justice (especially because I struggled to get it in focus).",1
"Quick shipping, very nice and attentive shop owner and the earrings look amazing üòä Im very happy with my purchase.",1
"The earrings were a little longer than I expected, but it ended up working out. I get compliments every day and one girl from the market said that she never wears earrings but would totally wear these. What a compliment to this seller! Thanks for making such unique products!",1
"Wow! I'm super happy with my order. Swift delivery, adjusting my address was no problem at all, the earrings look lovely, and the handwritten message was perfect, since my purchase was a gift for my best friend. Highly recommend!",1
"Unfortunately the earrings didn't ""fit"" my earlobe (didn't sit flat) but the quality is great and overall they are beautiful minimal earrings.",1
"Beautiful!! The seller was very attentive and fast to respond. They went out of their way to accommodate my custom request. I wanted specific colors, and they created exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments. I definitely recommend this seller. Customer service is excellent.",1
Gorgeous earrings with a custom arrangement of stones!,1
I love them so much so beautiful and was delivered very quickly would totally buy again,1
I love these.They fit great.,1
I love these! So cute! I never thought I'd buy these kind because I was afraid of how they would wear but they are very durable and easy to put on. Glad I got them now. Shipped fast and the seller is really nice to work with.,1
Love these crawlers!  I‚Äôve been liking for a replacement pair for 3+years!!,1
Ear Climbers are beautiful and wonderfully crafted.,1
This is so pretty and very comfortable to wear.  I will be getting more!,1
Love these earrings.  Have now got 5!  thank you for quick delivery and I love the packaging.  Will be back looking for more soon!  C,1
Love them & easy to put in. I will be getting some more really soon for the second holes in my lobes!,1
"Really simple, beautifully made earrings. Very comfortable to wear. Great that they can be threaded through the ear from the front or the back to give two different looks. Thanks for the great customer service. Will be back to buy more soon",1
"Quick delivery, super-cute packaging and great earrings. Really happy and will definitely buy from SilvaNova again!",1
"I love these tiny earrings so much! Will probably wear them everyday, they are perfect.

Ordered as a birthday gift for myself. Shipping took nearly 4 weeks (which is longer than the seller predicted). If you are in US & ordering a gift for someone else, plan ahead. Shipping from Kazakhstan takes FOREVER, y'all.

At some point, I was worried it would not arrive & Zhanat calmed me, & got me all information to help find the package & then it arrived the next day.

I will definitely purchase again from this seller in the future. Would recommend to others as well.",1
This came out exactly the way I wanted it. It's really cute & she even custom made me s matching stud for the other ear. Would definitely purchase from her again.,1
LOVE the earrings! I have gotten lots of compliments!,1

"So pretty, right down to the packaging. Fits well and I get so many compliments!",1
super fast shipping for a truly great item. thank you!,1
Plan on using these for my wedding in July! I have the look of them and was looking for something that would cover both my first and second holes. These are so sparkly so they are perfect!,1
They arrived 2 weeks after ordering & omg I am in love. They were a belated Mother‚Äôs Day present! I absolutely love them! I am probably about to order more!,1
Absolutely stunning climbers! I bought them for my sister for her birthday and they look even better in person than they do on the site. Great price and super fast shipping are an added bonus!,1
"Got these to replace a similar pair of ear climbers that broke, and I love this pair even more!",1
Love them! I bought these for my wedding day and they're perfect!,1
These leaf ear jackets add so much to different post earrings.  I love wearing them!,1
These are pretty and well made. Unfortunately my ears must be pierced too close to the edge as there is quite a gap between the laurel and my ear which loses some of the effect. There are even two holes on the backing to make it snugger and there is still a gap. I tried rotating the laurel to the side which snuggles it up to the side of my ear but I have to tighten it down so much to keep it in that rotate position that it pinches my ear. If I loosen it to be comfortable in the back it rotates back down and sits well separated from my lobe. I wanted to love these but I think I'll be on the lookout for a girlfriend with larger lobes to gift these beautiful earrings to.,1
These earrings are beautiful! Dainty but well-made. Excellent quality!!,1
"Pictures do not remotely capture the beauty of these gems!! This is my 2nd pair, the 1 set was beautiful I ordered up a size. Love Love Love them!!",1
These earrings really are beautiful! Very sparkly! ‚ú® Love them! I purchased two pairs of 5mm and one pair of 4mm. They look the same as my real diamond earrings.,1
I got the smallest size and it‚Äôs so beautiful and shiny and I love the back is screw on! Fast shipping and they gave me a coupon for buying. Thank you!,1
"Beautiful piece of jewelry! It has literally become my go-to earring. I infrequently take them off, except to shower )and I sometimes forget to do that, lol). Once a month I clean them in a mild solution of dawn and warm water and the stone is back shining brilliantly! Processing and shipping was fast. Will reorder from this shop!",1
"I got a lot of complements wearing these earring, their textures are so unique that it stands out, so well made, exceeded my expectations. This is a site to keep an out on for new products, love them!!",1
Really pretty! They look so classy.,1
The item came damaged and the seller replaced it immediately. Great service and love my earrings!,1
"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL earrings! I was looking for something unique, something not overwhelming, simple, goes with everything.... and these fit the bill. I also appreciated the backs that came with them. Those were unexpected. Great turnaround on the shipping, too!",1
"Very cute, love the way they look- modern but elegant.  Lovely presented packaging, fun to get in the mail, fast turnaround!",1
"Love these earrings! They are such a nice shape, and an easy everyday piece.",1

Absolutely gorgeous & exactly what asked for.  My order came super fast & was packaged beautifully. Earrings also have clip latch to comfortably hold onto ear without pulling on lobe. Would absolutely order again & refer a friend!,1

"I love these rings!!!! I already have 2 and have bought additional 2 as gifts and they'be been a huge hit! I have sensitive skin but have had these on for over 2 weeks now with no issues or irritations. I sometimes forget i even have them on, until i get compliments on them!Thank you",1
The earrings arrived fast and they look great as described. I think my ear lobes are too small for this type of ear crawler cause they don't hold it and they slip off my ear. But when on the right place they look beautiful,1
Beautiful Jeweler and lovely spirit!!!,1
"I absolutely loved my Ankh necklace. Quality is beautiful: necklace is a little short but I didn't check the dimensions when I got it . I‚Äôm really happy , Love it üôèüèªüôå",1

"Delivery took a little longer than I expected, but the seller was great and even offer to send another so I would get it on time. The earrings are small but lovely my 15 year old niece adores them and I have now ordered a 2nd pair for my sister. Great hypoallergenic too my niece can sleep in them without a reaction.",1
"Smaller than I thought, but that was ok. I really like these and am thinking of ordering another pair in a different colour!",1
"Nice earrings, as expected.  Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast.  They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them.  And  the backings are SO SMALL!!  They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears.  I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these.  It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine.",1
"These are really cute!  The stars are cut cleanly and they look like they do in the photos.  They are comfortable to wear and easy to clean.  This is the second set of earrings I've purchased (the other is a different star crawler) and the quality is consistent from this seller.   They seem delicate, but they've held up quite nicely so far.",1
Love these earrings. I wanted something small and cute for a second hole piercing. These are perfect! They arrived quickly too!,1
Super cute!,1
Love these earrings! The design is simple/minimalist but really effective - much more interesting than the norm with the circular jacket behind the stud earring. Thank You!,1
"Love this piece! Definitely elevates my earring game for sure! Lightweight, I actually sleep in it now, because it‚Äôs one of my everyday pieces. It was uncomfortable to sleep in the first night but now I‚Äôm used to it. Haven‚Äôt had any reaction to it either!
Love this, highly recommend!",1
They are so nice to wear! You don‚Äôt even notice them! Wonderful!,1
"They are so cool! My second pair from OtisJackson and they are just lovely, the items and the shop!",1
"My granddaughter picked these out for herself, and she is very happy with them.    They are dainty, but different!   They arrived safely from England and a stop at customs, and were attractively packaged.",1
absolutelly amazing erings.. a bit too long for my ers thou,1
Beautiful and just what I needed!! Also the customer service was excellent! Thank you!,1
"Love them, but they were a little longer than I would have liked. Great looking & beautifully made!",1
"Very comfortable, would wear them again",1
"I love these earrings! Because of the climber design, I can wear them 24/7, even during sleep without getting poked. I also appreciate the mixed metals so I can pair with gold or silver.",1
These earrings are gorgeous! I've already gotten so many compliments on them.,1
"Beautiful earrings, excellent quality. Highly recommend.",1
"They look beautiful. Unfortunately they do not stay put  and don't look like climbers when u wear them. They don't look like climbers when you wear them. they edges fall down. The earring BROKE only my SECOND time wearing it. shame, they were very pretty",1
Perfect. As described. Thank you!,1
"For the second year in a row, I purchased earrings from OSingulierBoutique, the pieces inspired by the tiny Greek islands of Amorgos (last year's purchase) and Koufonissia , (this year's purchase) - both places which we visit on our trips back 'Home' to Greece. 

The pieces are made well, durable, look beautiful, and best of all: They truly do remind us of our favorite places.  

The deep turquoise blue and gold in the Amorgos piece clearly take inspiration of the island, it's so obvious I can envision it. 
The same for the bright blue/greens of the Koufonissia piece!  the color of the Aegean Sea hitting the beach, and the bright white golden color of the sand are spot on. 

If a Patmos inspired piece is made, we'll take it!",1
I love these earrings. They can be dressed up or dressed down with a pair of jeans. They are great. Shipping was held up because of holidays but I was compensated with a lovely gift. Thank you.,1
absolutely stunning!!,1
Just as pictured.  Delicate and beautiful.  Shipped expeditiously.,1
very pretty and dainty earrings,1
daughter loved them for her second hole,1
"Very elegant and timeless! üïä These beautiful olive branch earrings are one of my most favorite earrings now, they look and feel so regal! The ornate and classical foliage design reminds me of ancient laurel leaves. I prefer wearing them as pictured, although they are stunning as ear climbers. Many thanks, Joanna!",1
"I purchased the bright silver olive leaf ear climbers for my 12-year-old daughter and they are gorgeous. Very delicate and appropriate for a girl, and a nice alternative for someone who doesn't wear big dangly earrings. They are a little trickier to get in than posts but she was able to do it herself without too much trouble.",1
These climbers are perfect! I have been wearing them everyday since I received them and they look and feel amazing!,1
"So cute! I love the level of detail, they look great. Thanks so much!",1
"Like it, don't love it. The earring was shinier in the picture than in person, it ended up being pretty matte. It was also pretty wide where it rests in the earlobe, so unless you wear gauge earrings, it is a little uncomfortable for the first few days. The shape is good, follows the curvature of the ear pretty well. Nice packaging and shipped fairly quickly for an international item.",1
"These earrings are absolutely stunning! :)
They were a custom order and Anna immediately made them for me: I'm so so happy, I'm wearing them every day!
I adore threader earrings so much and the eye charm is simply lovely (so shiny!).
Can't wait to buy more from their shop! ‚ô•",1
"These earrings are beautiful!! I hadn't originally realized that the seller was from Poland, and I'm in the United States so I was a little worried about shipping time, but it wasn't bad at all! Great earrings, let's me mix things up a bit, having only one piercing hole on each ear, a lot easier to put in than I had expected",1
"These earrings are AMAZING. I wear them everyday and don‚Äôt need to take them out to shower or sleep. I have then looped through both my love piercings and it looks adorable, I get so many compliments ‚ò∫Ô∏è best part is I‚Äôm not allergic to them and I have VERY sensitive ears!",1
"Absolutely gorgeous earrings and super fun to wear! Seller was super friendly and made my original character so tiny and perfect! The details are incredible and very light weight, yet also very durable! Also the perfect size for my ears as I don't like chunky, hefty earrings, so I'd say they're just right. I'd give more stars if I could and I'll definitely be back for more! :)",1
"Absolutely adorable. The backs aren‚Äôt quite the tightest grip, so they can be a bit loose, but it‚Äôs manageable once they‚Äôre actually in your ears. Love love love the design!",1
Love these! I sent her numerous photos of my Dalmatian and she did a wonderful job with my dogs most unique spots! These are smaller than I anticipated but that's not a bad thing. 10/10 would buy again. The order was completed very quickly and arrived with a bunch of awesome Australian stamps on the package.,1
Amazing service! So quick and efficient! The earrings were exactly how I wanted them. So in love! Can‚Äôt thank Jessica enough!,1
"These are so cool!  Thanks! 
The shipping time was ok for the distance,  the transaction was smooth and pleasant.",1

It was beautiful I loved it . I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments too,1
"I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!!! They are super wearable/comfortable. I work in an office answering the phone much more then I should and these don‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôve had people ask me if these were designer, stating that they almost bought a pair just like these for a lot more money.... like add a zero.",1
"i love this earring! i have not taken it off since i got it, and i will be ordering an extra one or two so that if i misplace it, i will have a backup. very pleased and love the seller!",1
"Love these! I've gotten a lot of compliments on these beautiful, simple earrings",1

"I bought these for 9 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves them! She loves how they look like she has a second piercing and how they twinkle on her ears. I‚Äôm a huge fan as well, absolutely adorable on her :) this is her first pair of ear climbers and now not her last. Well made and exactly as described.
Thank you!",1
Seller is super awesome and answered my questions really fast! These earrings  look great even with my slightly stretched ears. Love them!,1

"These earrings are beautiful! They remind me of my trip to Poland, which makes me super happy. The shipping and packaging were superb. I will purchase again from this shop.",1
Just what I wanted.  Wearing vintage clothing to a party and needed these watermelon earrings to match 50's style swing dress with watermelon pattern I'm wearing.  Well made.  Seller sent promptly and with good communication.,1
"I love them.  So light, no tugging on my ears and they look fabulous!!  Thank you!!  :D",1
"My second purchase from Elisa! on the site there was not the size I wanted so I made a request to Elisa: service top and I am super happy with my purchases 
Elisa is really a trusted person and does everything to satisfy us. No surprise.The products are of quality and really correspond to the photos presented.My bangles are beautiful !",1
The package came in a great amount of time and my boyfriend loved the quality! I definitely recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è,1
So much prettier than the picture! the surface of the pop socket is slightly convexed which just gives it a nice smooth feeling to the touch,1
"Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend.",1
Love these earrings! This is the second pair I've bought (I stupidly lost one of the first set) and Deborah was very helpful and lovely to talk to. Would 100% recommend the product and seller. x,1
Researched many options for earrings like these and very happy with my purchase. Very light and comfortable.,1

secondly..the tiny gold and crystal studs i ordered are not only oh so pretty and dainty...they arrived in what felt like a heartbeat‚úåüèª
they were the perfect little giftüôåüèª",1
"Amazing! I love it! I got the 40cm and wasn't expecting it to sit so high up on my neck (something to consider), I have grown to really love it & the seller offered to swap it straight away if I wasn't happy - she's so lovely!",1
They‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous and arrived very quickly. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again!,1
Just received this item today. Absolutely love love love these beautiful earrings. The packaging was quite lovely as well. Adorable pouch for the earrings and the screw on back of cuff is so comfortable. I am a new satisfied customer and will certainly be ordering again soon! I double the 5 star rating  and give a 10.,1
"I'm traveling at the moment, so can't provide a photo now. But I'll try to add it when I return home. But these ear cuff earrings looks just as they did in the photo on the site. And they look fabulous on! They are adjustable where they clip at the top of the ear, and once you find the correct amount of pressure for your ear, they are remarkably comfy to wear. 

The seller boxed them up beautifully. Clearly someone who cares about her business and her customers.",1
"These earrings are STUNNING! Gold posts for my very sensitive ears, and they are SO comfortable. Fast shipping, wonderful communication....these will be perfect for my wedding. So happy with my purchase!",1
"I ordered the emerald green crawlers earrings for my wedding day.  They are stunning!! The seller also enclosed a pair of emerald green studs per my request, I cant praise them enough.  Awesome shop!! I can‚Äôt wait to wear them in December.",1
The seller is very nice and the earrings are original! I was looking for unique earrings and I found them :),1
"LOVE these earrings! They are exactly as described and I couldn't be happier with them. My ears are pretty sensitive to the types of materials I can wear, and so far, my ears haven't reacted to the material. Very happy with these earrings!",1
"I LOVE THESE! They look elegant, simple, they are beautiful and made very well. They came as expected when I ordered them in a pretty box with instructions how to put them on. I recommend 10/10",1
these are so beautiful omg,1
Stunning earrings! Very elegant and easy to put on. Will definitely be buying from this shop again! Love!,1
Gorgeous and easy to use. Fast shipping very happy with my purchase ‚ò∫,1
"Love it!!! Fine lines, high quality design and execution. Was bit sceptical about positioning and sliding down my ear - but it stays where it‚Äôs supposed to be. Thank you very much!!!",1
I love these so much! They came in a good amount of time and are so cute! I will be buying more from here üòç,1
Beautifull material and design. Communication about shipping is good as well. Really happy with it and people around me think the same about it ;),1
Super easy to order with fast shipping and she wrote a lovely note on my behalf. Thanks so much!,1
My first climber earrings..... the pearls are dainty and look fine... am receiving compliments! Thankyou Charlie.,1
These ear climbers are really beautiful and they‚Äôre of good quality. Would deffo recommend this brand!,1
"Beautiful delicate climbers, light weight so don't feel like they will slip and exactly as described. Great communication too!",1
"Very elegant and pretty, can wear for work or date night.",1
"The ear climber turned out to be a little shorter and daintier than I thought it would be based on the photo, but it looks great! Perfect for dressing up an ear of steel barbells or studs.",1
Thanks a lot for this beautiful flower light garland - made with love and care. It came with two extra light bulbs - super - and it arrived very fast. I am so pleased - thank yoooouuu ‚ú®üåü‚ú®,1
"I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!",1
I had a great experience with HarshandSweet.  The items I received were as expected and even better.  These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.,1
"Love the design, lots of compliments when I wear them.  First class, friendly service.  Very talented maker.",1
"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day.  Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!",1
"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. I think it looks better with one molecule and one stud asymmetrical style, but I did get a dopamine and a serotonin if I want to really make some happiness ;)",1
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!,1
"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!",1
Love these!! They‚Äôre so cute and I get compliments on them all the time ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
I love these earrings! They are so simple but elegant and good for everyday wear. They are very comfortable and I can sleep in them withoutbeing poked by a post. Very happy :),1
I loved it.Its perfect.,1
I love the earrings there so nice and comfortable they came a couple of days ago and I‚Äôve already worn both pairs I bought,1
Absolutely LOVE this ear crawler!  It‚Äôs very delicate and pretty!,1
Love these ear climbers!,1
"Beautiful packaging, absolutely lovely quality. Enjoy it very much I've gotten so many compliments. Thank you!",1
looks great! I love these :),1
"I really love these earrings,they are just amazing!
I have had them coloured in a galaxy which are deep blue,purple,pink,with a hint of violet. My favourite range of colours.
Everyone has noticed them and thought how unusual and eye catching they are.
I've worn them in 4 different ways so far,I love clothes and accessories that you can change and manipulate to create a different look,like these ear climbers.
The packaging was beautifully presented,which showed how caring and creative this seller really is.
I have ordered another set of ear climbers which I'm looking forward to receiving soonüòÄ
Thank you so much Panagiotis you are quite an artistüòò xxxxx",1
I just love these earrings.  Quality is extremely solid.  Easy to put on.  Everyone gives me compliments when I wear them.  I love the bright color.,1
These look good. They stay in place all day. Great earrings!,1
I love these earrings! Arrived quickly to the UK. A great size,1
Beautiful little set. Sized more for a child than for an adult but the quality is amazing. Shipping was over a month from Israel to US.,1
I was worried when I received it and saw how to wear the ear climber... but now I wear it all the time and absolutely love it.,1
"What can I say, other than how pleased I am? Ordering was easy, hassle-free, and the items arrived in perfect condition. I couldn't be more happy!",1
Beautiful piece! Excited to continue supporting this shop many many times in the future!,1
"I absolutely love this climber - it's such a cool, interesting design, and looks great on. Thanks!",1
"I already got so many compliments on these earrings, people have to look twice. Great shop, top quality!",1
Thank you i love it üòç,1
They are amazing!!! Comfortable and look fabulous!!!,1
"What a cool versatile piece of jewelry.  It can be worn in many different ways and has a very stylish look to them.   Bought them for my wife on Valentines day, she loved them.",1
OMG.  These are beautiful.  Description says wedding earrings but I'm wearing them everyday!   Looks classy with a dress or shorts and flipflops (I've done both).  Get them without delay.  You won't regret this purchase!,1
This ear cuff is beautiful! It takes a long time to ship to the US (arrived almost a month later than expected) but I found it was worth the wait :),1
"These are lovely, dainty, and unique  earrings.  Purchasers, please be aware when putting them on, they are immensely delicate.  When I opened the box upon its receipt the wire to one of the larger stars was bent.  I believe it happened during the shipping process because only one of the earrings was secure in the box; the one that was not secured was the bent one.  My son makes jewelry and fixed it right up, no problem.

These really are lovely; I recommend them to everyone.  I look forward to shopping here again.

Thank you!",1
Love them! So light and comfortable to wear! Exactly what I hoped for!,1
Daughter loves the cuffs!  I purchased both sides.  She wears them together sometimes and they look adorable!,1
"I ADORE these earrings. Wore them at RDC2, and lots of people saw them and loved them too <3",1
Gave this as a gift to my friend! She loved it; they're so cute! And good quality. The packaging they came in was super adorable. Thank you!,1
These are so comfy I don't even know I'm wearing them. Love them and they shipped quickly and were package very nicely. Thank you,1
Very unique and beautiful earrings.,1
"This is the second time, I ordered jewellery from Zozi, and I absolutely love it. Also, she is extremely helpful and friendly. Thanks again :)",1
Well - I've barely taken them off since I got them!  Love these so much.  Especially the versatility that you can mix it up and wear just the studs or combine the back and studs.  These are gorgeously made and fit my ears wonderfully.,1
The jewelry is beautiful and made my daughter very happy on her graduation day. We ordered last minute and the store owner was super responsive and we received everything very quickly.,1
"I have ruined my ears with gauges in the past, the holes are small but still too big for regular earrings these work so perfectly, they are so beautiful in person and well made!! So perfect for my wedding day. Came very quickly, my only criticism is the packaging. Could be more nicely packaged it up. But the earrings themselves were not damaged or anything at all.",1
I love the earrings! They are beautiful! Now I‚Äòm hooked and need to buy more :),1
"I‚Äôm so pleased with these earrings they are beautiful! I ordered 2 pairs for my bridesmaids and was a bit wary of ordering from overseas but I‚Äôm so glad I did. Great communication from the seller, nicely packaged and shipped very quickly.",1
These earrings are so pretty and sparkly! Love them! Shipping was also very fast. Thanks!,1
"Gifted these to my sister and we, both, love them! Arrived in a perfect little gift box w/protective bag included for storing, plus extra earring backs. The ""hugs&kisses"" are such a cute idea! Thanks so much!!!",1
"Wow, I have always had positive experiences on etsy but this had been the best yet. Macalania was so quick to ship my order out, and the earrings I recieved are exactly what I hoped for! I didn't expect the additional backs, but really appreciate them. I'm always losing earring backs. Thank you so much, I'll definitely be a return customerüòÅ",1
"Amazing quality, beautiful packaging. Very fast shipping. Thank you for the extra backs too! I have them to my Mom for her birthday and she was over the moon for them!",1
Beautiful. Seems to be pretty well made. I didn't realize the earrings were actually 3 separate pieces but nonetheless GREAT. They come with different types of backs so you can use the ones that feel the most secure.,1
"These are simply beautiful!  They are simple but have quite a bit of detail.  I love them!  It took me a little bit of time to figure out how to insert them and sometimes they dont stay up running alongside my earlobe (they go into drop earring position) but they look beautiful nonetheless. When I ordered them, Joanna contacted me immediately to confirm that she got my order and approximate time to make them.  I got them sooner than I expected which was great and they were beautifully packaged with care and love!  Will definitely buy from Joanna again. Thank you!",1
I love love love these earrings! I wish they were a little cheaper for a pair lol but I couldn't resist! They're just as beautiful in person! Also they shipped super fast and there was a cute thank you note written. üòä,1
"Absolutely beautiful workmanship.  The sweep effect of the ear pin really flatters the natural curve of the ear and you can see the effort put into the detail of each and every leaf.  Once the earring is in, the back of the pin can be pinched closer to the ear so it stays in place (through jumping, shaking your head, and dancing) all the while being comfortable to wear.  Thank you so much Joanna!  I couldn't be happier!",1
I am extremely pleased with my purchase! It is apparent that a lot of care and artistry has been put into the making of this delightful earring.  It is very detailed (even prettier than in the picture) and so lightweight I sometimes forget that I have it on. The seller is extremely helpful and kind and responds very fast. I will definitely buy again from this store! Thanks a lot!,1
"OMG love love love these! They look amazing! I have tiny, baby ears but luckily these are adjustable!",1
Love these earrings! I wore them to a grad party recently and I got tons of compliments on them! Very happy thx!,1
"the earrings are beautifully made, was shipped quickly, and they felt very comfortable on the ears. I thought they looked heavy but they are actually very lightweight. I got many compliments when I wore them.",1
"These are so pretty! Dainty but made well , so cute on, got compliments right away. Fast ship, well wrapped to protect, very delighted!üòä",1
I have been wanting one of these for awhileüíó Utterly  mesmerizing and mysterious design- I wear it every day!!!  Thank you for this favorite ringüíõ‚ù§üíô,1

Really pretty summery earrings. Delivery was almost by return. Great service!,1
These earrings are gorgeous and already causing people to admire them!,1
Love love love these unusual and well-made earrings. I really like the adjustable depth holes on the stem -- everybody has different ears. haha. They add just the right touch to many of my outfits. Thank you!,1
"Beautifully made. Tested and no allergic reaction. Gorgeous. Just as pictured. I love that they are adjustable so you can customize to your unique ears - so comfortable. The jacket can be adjusted in 3 ways to customize the hang length, and the locks on the studs can be adjusted in 2 ways to customize how tight they fit. 
Artist was very responsive and professional in all communications, including a Canada Post hiccup (Canada Post system issue, nothing to do with artist).
Highly recommend this shop. Beautiful designs and high quality.",1
"Love love love these. Beautiful quality, they sit perfectly even on my attached earlobes!",1
"wow... the earrings are stunning - I have received tons of compliments within first hour of wearing them. Brilliant, fast delivery, beautiful packaging. I will come back for more soon :)",1
These earrings are so cute! Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping and the packing was so cute. I also loved the personalized thank you card. Would highly recommend!!! I will 100% would purchase again from this shop.,1
They are perfect! I have had several complements seeing as I work in a Veterinary clinic. Thank you for the fast shipping!,1
Completely obsessed with these earrings. I got a pair for me (just got a black kitten) and a pair for my mother in law who owns a Siamese. The ‚Äúwhite‚Äù kitty earrings are more Siamese looking to me so they are perfect and I know she will love them. The handwritten card was so cute and thoughtful as well. The baggies the earrings came with are also adorable and make for a great gift. Thank you Kellan & Keira!,1
I will be back again to buy more ! Super cute and the card that came with them felt so nice and personal!!!,1
"I absotuley love the sterling climber and stud climber earrings. I most definitely be sharing with my friends on face book. I cannot wait to wear them. Thank you so , so very much.

Really Dainty and beautiful!  Get lots of compliments!,1

Would definitely purchase from this seller again.",1
"Just as described and just the most fun idea I've seen for raincloud earrings! The cloud pieces are lovely and the drops are fun. I'm not a huge fan of how much glitter is on each of the middle drops, but that's a nit pick. I hope the artist tries this design out with silver metal sometime!! Would totally buy a set!

"These hoops are great and the costumer service was excellent. I live in the US so shipping wasn‚Äôt trackable and it took a while, but it was worth it. I originally got 8mm hoops, and they fit perfectly in one ear (shown in photo) but were too large in the other ear because my piercings are so uneven (thanks Claire‚Äôs). After chatting with the shop owner, I ordered a 7mm pair and those fit well in the ear that the 8mm were too large for. I bought these to have earrings comfortable enough to sleep/shower in and never take out and these definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint - very comfortable!",1

I have a strange address, but the shop owner was more than helpful with working out how to get these earrings to me. They were very sweet and replies were prompt.",1
The earnings are super cute but they don‚Äôt come with backs and they start to come out of my ear. My first day wearing them I lost one. So sad that I spent so much money on something I only got to wear once.,1

It's so great to open the card and untie the jackets.,1

Shipped faster then expected, owners responded to all my questions. Overall good experience with this shop. Will purchase from them again!",1
"I actually reordered these because I lost my last set and loved them so much. They‚Äôre really comfortable and great for everyday wear - they don‚Äôt have posts to dig in to your neck, no hoops to snag in things. And sooo pretty!!",1
"They're really pretty! I should've checked my ear measurements before purchasing these though, the space I got where these should go is smaller/differently shaped than the models. I am able to put them on and after a bit of a struggle get them to stay somewhat where they should be, but it's quite noticeable that they're not really made for my ear-shape. With that said they have stayed put for the 2 hours I've had them in, and they are comfortable.
The shipping took quite a bit longer than it normally would, but that I will blame the pandemic for.
Thank you!! :)",1
"I'd had my eye on these for a long time and I'm so glad I finally ordered. Shipped on time. Wrapped in lovely, minimal, nearly plastic-free packaging. Loved the ribbon pull on the envelope - clever and cute. 
The earrings are beautiful; delicate, yet sturdy enough that I'm not worried about them breaking. They're just as I hoped they would be.",1

They are absolutelly beatiful. I Love Them! And should they ever break, I‚Äòll order them again from this seller! And they are sterling silver! I know because I am allergic to cheep (unreal) jewelry.

"I purchased this fake septum to see how I would look with the real piercing, and I was super shocked by how beautiful the quality is. It looks real. It was a little tight to put on, but since the material isn't too hard, I was able to bend it open a little more to fit better. It's not uncomfortable at all; in fact, I wore it for about 20 minutes and forgot I had it on.",1

"I had seen ear climbers on other ears and wondered how they were anchored if by studs or long wires,  I am intrigued but am  concerned if the wire hook at the bottom rubs against the back of your ear?  I have not tried them on yet
 but wanted to hear your reply first.  I love them; they are beautiful and look well made.  Shipping was faster than I expected.  Thank you for the extra gift of a wish bracelet and know what my wish/prayer will be!",1

These DO take the full month to arrive but well worth it they are adorable!! Love the packaging!!!,1
"I love the versatility of this earring design. It's easy to picture wearing these as only studs on both ears, with the stud plus earring jacket on both ears, or a stud on one side and a stud plus an earring jacket on the other side.  This look is pure fun. ‚ù§Ô∏è!  Marilee",1
Very pretty and unique earrings. Didn't realize they would be matte silver rather than shiny but love them anyway and goes with other matte silver I own.  Thanks for your wonderful design and craftsmanship,1
It took a long time to be delivered but it made in the promised time and the wait was totally worth it. They are well made pieces! Very pretty!,1

"My experience with this seller was amazing! I have never had a package lost in the mail before and was worried about my package since it had been a month since my order was placed. I contacted the seller concerned, and they immediately sent out another package which arrived in days. I was so happy about their patience and understanding in the situation.

For the earrings, they were exactly what I expected! I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they‚Äôre beautiful. The only thing is you have to get used to putting it in your ear, especially if you‚Äôre putting it in your second hole that you rarely put earrings in. My mom prefers them in her first hole, but I think they look beautiful in a second hole with a statement earring in the first. 

They‚Äôre not expensive at all and they come with great quality and customer service!:)",1
Perfect size for every day. Love my earrings! I also received them pretty quickly after ordering.,1
I ordered 9 pairs for my girls and only 6 arrived. I messaged the company and they were super apologetic and helpful! The earrings themselves are dainty and sweet! Excited for my girls to wear them for my 12/1/18 wedding.,1

Beautiful color.  Love that you can wear them several different ways.  They're very comfortable, and easy to wear.  They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect!   I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service.",1
"An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations.  They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun!  Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings.  While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!",1

I've been wanting to get cute hoops to do a stacked look and these are perfect! They are a little difficult to get on but SO cute! My only complaint is that they do sometimes get caught on my shirts and pillows.,1
I sent these to my daughter to help cheer her up at college. She was so happy to receive them in the mail and said she loved them . They were shipped and received very quickly. The DHL shipping was a little pricey but well worth it knowing where the package was at all times and arrived the day before it was suppose to arrive. Thank you so much!

Beautiful!!,1
"Beautiful, these work great with my work wardrobe, and add a lot. I love the design.",1
Beautiful and high quality as always! Thank you!! üòò,1
"I'm loving these climbers....these are my first of this style so there was a learning curve to figure out how to get them in easily, but now it's a piece of cake. Love the minimalist design & hammered texture. They're perfect!",1
"Pros:   Minimalistic. Super pretty. Everybody compliments them. I can sleep and shower and do everything with them. My hair hasn't gotten stuck in them yet. All-around superb purchase. 

 Cons:  really hard for me to put in my ears. Mostly because I think one of my holes is a little crooked.  I won't be taking them out anytime soon, and it's already been a few weeks, so it doesn't matter too much.",1
"Absolutely love these earrings! They were a little tricky to get on the first time, since I haven't had a style like this before.  But they fit nicely, and were exactly what I wanted - something minimal but a little trendy.  I'm not one for big earrings and these are perfect!",1
I seriously love them.  I pretty much haven't taken them out since I got them and find sleeping in them to be comfortable.  I did have to pull them apart a tiny bit just because they were hurting my ears but now they fit awesome.  But I love them!!!!,1
I love my earrings so much. it is exactly how the picture shows. I got mine in silver. My expectations were beyond met. I'm so happy with the quality and excited to wear them. Just in time for my birthday & father's day (I got my husband's name),1
So many compliments! I lost one and ordering more!,1
Beautiful! Really great quality and they look stunning. The shop owner is super helpful and is very good with communication!,1
"So these super quality huggies I got it as a gift. My friends totally loved it. They came in a super green faux suede pouch, just perfect to offer as gift. Totally recommend. Go dig in for amazing contemporary affordable jewelry.",1
This brooch is beyond beautiful and well crafted. It is a bit smaller than I had expected it to be but that just adds to making it look delicate. It's perfect :),1
"Stunning earrings. High quality, perfect medium size, highly attention for packaging. Fast delivery. Very attentive seller. Totally recommend. Dig in for super quality yet very affordable prices contemporary jewelry.",1
"I really love this earring! It‚Äôs a little smaller than I expected based on the photo, but it worked out really well with my other piercings. I also thought it would jiggle a bit, but the wire allows some movement while keeping it from flopping around. The only downside is waiting for shipping from Bulgaria to the states which took 18 days, but it was worth it.",1
"I‚Äôm a BIG fan of this feather jewelry. It‚Äôs not too heavy and looks very classy with the little opal stone. I must confess, I didn‚Äôt get this for a necklace. I actually got it to take off the chain and use as a dangle on my helix ear piercings. It does jiggle some without the wire used in the other actual feather earring sold by this store, but that‚Äôs cool with me. I like it that way! It‚Äôs also a little bigger than it appears in the photo too. So be aware of that. The only downside is waiting for shipping from Bulgaria to the states which took 18 days, but it was worth it.",1
I waited a while to review to see how the material would hold up in showers and omg I love so so much. Looks as good as new and the style is so different. Get this! üòç,1
"I ordered 3 pieces from Sofi and had a problem with my first order, which was my own fault. Sofi was so very helpfull and made me a very happy costumer which will definitely buy again. The piercings are well made with magic and love! The opal one is my favourite - never owned such a special nose ring!!!! Thaaaank you!",1
"I absolutely love this climber; I get compliments on it all the time! Over the years I have somehow lost it and replaced it twice (TOTALLY on me) and would buy it again in a heartbeat. Sasha is wonderfully helpful and accommodating, and is just lovely to communicate with. I really appreciate the effort and care she puts into connecting whenever I make a purchase. Definitely buying more of her beautiful pieces in the future!",1
"I love this thing so much, I wore it every day until I lost it, now I have it again. Thank you so much!",1
"The perfect climber! It hugs my ear snug and doesn‚Äôt slip down. 

This piece is a sure eye catcher. I wore it today and was complimented twice.

I love Sasha‚Äôs work so much. Her design skills are as great as her gold smithing. 

*shipping was quick and her packaging is so great. I can‚Äôt praise her enough!",1
Bought the smaller climber as a helix piercing. Sasha was so helpful with all my questions. I am totally thrilled with it!!,1
Beautiful earrings!  Fast shipping!,1
Love these! My first pair of ear crawlers :),1
These earrings are beautiful but unfortunately too large in width for my ears. One earring fell out within a couple hours of putting them on for the first time. Maybe better for those with thicker earlobes (the earring width is about 6mm).,1
Great item!  Quick service!  Great seller!,1
"Got the opal ear jackets for my wife & she loves them. Made a perfect Valentine's Day gift. Shipping was on time & gift was wrapped up in a cute bow that helped me out w/the whole Valentine's Day thing.

The quality is exceptional and he has some very unique beautiful treasures in his shop. Thank you Adigo .,1
Just received my bracelet....thanks to the global health crisis it took forever.  BUT it was well worth the wait.  I LOVE IT!!!,1
"Wonderful shopping experience! Seller is very responsive with communications and generous with information about the products. Good follow-thru re shipping details and careful packing. Aside from accolades for Adigo, I love everything I purchased and will definitely shop here again! thanks, Adigo!",1
"Absolutely gorgeous antique silver Berber earrings! Beautiful presentation, safely packaged, fast shipping! Excellent seller, highly recommended! I am a repeat customer!üòäüëçüíïüå∏",1
"I LOVE these earrings! I got them in gold because sterling silver irritates my skin and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. 

They also shipped way faster than the estimated date, so that was a bonus. 

Will definitely be buying again from Kolera! So many cute quality pieces for a very reasonable price.",1
These hoops earrings are perfect. They're exactly the thickness that I wanted. I am so pleased!,1
"Michelle, the owner created 2 pieces the exact way I wanted them to be. It was so nice and easy to work with her while she created the pieces. The communication was quick, easy and always helpful. She worked on my pieces quickly and they got to me as quickly! The quality of the jewelry is beautiful. Everything is made with attention and knowledge, you can see it! My pieces are even more beautiful in person. It came nicely packaged with a sweet hand written note. The whole experience from start to end was a big A+! I 100% recommend her shop!",1
Obsessed with these.  Get a ton of compliments and a few people tell me they were going to get their own pair.  Seller was super responsive and helpful.  Highly recommend,1

I love them! Subtle and interesting.,1
Very cute. You can also change out the front piece and keep the lobe jacket. Now if I can figure out how to make it a screw back it will be perfect! Thank you!,1
"Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they‚Äôre always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I‚Äôll probably buy from the seller again.",1
"These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I put them in my fourth holes to wrap up into my cartilage, and I love them! I also purchased two other pairs of the clusters of three (in photo), and they are really pretty! I would highly recommend!",1
I paired this with another opal earring stud from this shop and they go so beautiful together! i recently pierced my 3rd hole and used this earring to replace the piercing jewelry and i‚Äôve had no issues so far as i‚Äôm sensitive to most jewelry. the quality of this shop is amazing and i love this piece so much! so dainty yet makes a statement.,1
"Wasn't sure if this earring would work with my flat piercing but it ended up being SO cute!! I love the daintiness and how it matches the curvature of my ear nicely. Even better, it doesn't bother me when sleeping! Siham was so sweet and super responsive - I'll definitely be a returning customer. Totally recommend!",1
Super cute! My sister and law loved it. Really god quality. Simply but chic.,1
I love them so much ! I‚Äôve owned a lot of climber style earrings. Some of the backings are really flimsy or too far apart to be able to squeeze them together to fit your ear. These ones are perfect !!!,1
Super cute!! I love how they are a little bit edgyüòç I highly recommend‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Love, love these earrings!  Ordered for as a graduation gift and the recipient was ecstatic. Thank you.",1

Amazing seller! She customized my order to fit my existing ring.  It‚Äôs perfect and she is amazing and so very helpful. Would definitely order from here again. The ring is awesome.,1
These are the perfect size for what I was looking for!  Great quality earrings!  I will definitely be back for more!  Thank you!,1
"Slightly bigger than what I'd expected, but still fits my ear perfectly. Looks gorgeous, and loved the packaging!",1
"Very good quality climber, fit my ear just right and arrived as expected. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these! I cannot help but recommend this shop. However, if you are shipping in europe, the delivery will take some time but the wait will be worth it once they arrive! ;) Love them!",1
Took forever to get here but it was worth the wait. The earrings are beautiful and worth every cent. Super satisfied with my purchase.,1

I reached out, knowing they were in Thailand and me in the states, to see if I would still receive in time for my upcoming wedding in March.  With their prompt response, I was told about 2-3 weeks from purchase date.  I received my package 10 days later (order date Jan 30, delivered Feb 9).  AMAZING! And of course the product is absolutely beautiful and cannot wait to wear on my wedding day! Thank you so so much!",1

Beautiful earrings!,1
Lovely! Just the right size for my diamond earrings.  The gold is just the right amount of shine to show them off. Very pleased with this purchase and the seller.,1

These are so cute! Exactly what I was looking for!,1
Beautiful  blue delicate climbers. Nice packaging and quick shipping,1
"Omg. I can‚Äôt stress enough how gorgeous these are! A little heavy (expected, since they‚Äôre metal) so I maybe wouldn‚Äôt wear them all-day everyday, but for certain occasions they are FABULOUS!",1
"These earrings are SO adorable; I absolutely love the origami design! My pair is painted a little more orange than I'd like, but that's the nature of handmade items. The shipping was super quick (about 2 weeks only!) and it was packaged very well. I also had to sign for it, which is good extra security. I would definitely recommend this shop & order from them again! :)",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this pin! It's very clean cut and painted, and looks exactly as pictured. I'll most likely keep it on the card too, since it has a nice little background. The shipping was super quick (about 2 weeks only!) and it was packaged very well. I also had to sign for it, which is good extra security. I would definitely recommend this shop & order from them again! :)",1
"I LOVE!!! It‚Äôs even cuter and higher quality than I expected. The shipping did take about a month but I expected that and didn‚Äôt mind. :) It is a bit thicker than i expected (quite a bit more than a normal pop socket), so if you‚Äôre someone who carries your phone in your pocket often that might complicate things. Not an issue for me though. Great work!",1
"My girl and the keyring, not best pic but I am thrilled. Thanks",1
"This shop is the bomb. I ordered these in gold, and they accidentally sent silver. I contacted them, and let them know the silver was ok - it was still pretty. I thought they would just refund the price difference. But they sent me a gold pair on the spot! I'm so grateful that they did, the gold is so so so gorgeous. Highly recommend this shop.",1
These came in today and I absolutely love them! perfect size and gorgeous! Will definitely order from this shop again!,1
I love these! I ordered them fr my cousin for Christmas but I'm so gunna get me some too!! They look adorable!!,1
"I love, love, love the feather ear climbers. They're exactly as pictured, and they're the right size for my ears. Shop owner was pleasant to deal with, and it took less than three weeks for them to arrive at my doorstep. Highly recommend.",1
to say I'm obsessed with this climber is to undersell it. I love it so much. I have a lot of metal sensitivities and I've been wearing this for two days with no reactions. Worth the wait for international shipping!,1
These are now a new favorite pair. I love them and have worn them nearly every day! Thankyou!,1
"As picture, timely delivery seeing as it came half way round the world. Quality earrings.",1
"I tried to take a picture that shows what the earrings look like in and out. These are awesome! They're super comfy and easy to put in and take off. I even where them to bed and working out. They do take a while from order time to arrival, which is definitely to be expected of such high-quality handmade pieces. Not a criticism! Just something to consider when figuring out when to purchase :)",1
I love the earrings. I have terrible metal allergies and these have been in for over a week with no irritation. They are comfortable to sleep in and I get a lot of compliments. My only complaint is shipping took weeks! If you are good to wait and wait they are a great purchase.,1
I have very sensitive ears and the titanium option does not make my ears itchy! They are very comfortable. Can see myself wearing these to bed. Delivery was a bit on the longer side... BUT I am Canadian. They did have to travel quite a bit üòä. The titanium ones have a bit of a duller finish to them. Would go with another material is you prefer shiny. I might end up having to buy them in white gold too hehehe.,1
"Like someone else mentioned, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering but I LOVE these earrings. There's no back on them. It just twists through and you can't even feel that you're wearing them. And they look unique and very cute.  Nice design! Received 2 weeks from order date.",1
Fun necklace! I had it color customized and love the way it turned out!,1
"This necklace was better than expected! Very well made, and the magnetic clasp was fantastic! The packaging was beautifully executed and my friend was blown away by the gift! I will definitely order again!",1
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!",1
This product is beautiful in real life and so cute. These were a Christmas gift for my mom and she loves that she can sometimes only wear one backing or she puts the backing with other earrings. It's a winner for sure. Will be buying from them again. Plus shipping was mad fast!,1
So beautiful.  Well made. Beautiful stones. They are even prettier in person! Thank you!,1
I love my eat crawlers.  They are so unique!   I get complements and comments on them all the time,1

Packaged lovely.  Shipped in the time frame stated and arrived quickly after shipping.",1

"I absolutely LOVE these earrings!! They are not my go to, everyday earrings! Comfy to sleep in too! I added a rubber back to help hold them in and i haven‚Äôt had a single issue! Highly recommend!!",1
"A crap photo, but that doesn't mean I love them any less! Rough finish, a little wobbly, but very sleek and minimal. Love, love, love.",1
"I didn‚Äôt necessarily need customer service, but the shop owner still kept in touch with me about the status of my order, which I did appreciate. 
These are gorgeous. I absolutely *love* them. 
I have super sensitive ears that experience irritation and/or pain fairly easily and was a little worried that a snug earring would not be possible for me, but I‚Äôve been wearing them since they arrived days ago. I have yet to encounter any problems at all. Very exciting! 
I will definitely be giving this shop my business again in the future; I‚Äôm delighted with my purchase. Thank you! ü•∞",1

"Love these amethyst rose gold filled earring charms! These are delicate appearing, but are well made & sturdy. I wear these alone or mix and match up to a total of 3 charms per hoop to coordinate with clothes worn. Great price & quality, designer very dependable!

Absolutely gorgeous and so unique! Be prepared as they did take about six weeks to do you delivered.That was truly my only concern,1
"I really LOVE these earrings. The stones are small and dainty so they are very tasteful, comfortable, pretty.  I can't wear all costume jewelry because of allergies to some metals, so I asked Ara about these earrings and was assured these would be okay, and they are great! No problems at all!!! I will certainly be ordering more jewelry from Ara because her pieces are well made and her customer service is great.",1

"These earrings are just so stunning and well made. I got these in both emerald and sapphire. The blue of the sapphire is so deep. These stones look like genuine emeralds and sapphires. The quality of the gems and the earrings overall surpasses the price. The gold looks better than some of my solid gold pieces. Don‚Äôt let the dainty design fool you.

I highly recommend these earrings and this shop. Fala is a pleasure to work with.",1

"The earrings are delicate and beautiful and I'm very happy with my purchase. Benitta got back to me in a timely manner with any questions I had, and overall, I'm very happy with my order. 

I only gave it 4 stars, however, because the of the packaging. The gift box it came in had a blob of whiteout on the inside of the lid, and the box was a bit dusty with marks on the inside as well. It looked rather cheap compared to the actual product itself (the earrings are gorgeous!) so I was a bit underwhelmed. But what I ordered is more important than the packaging it came in, and the earrings look just like the picture, so overall I'm really happy with my purchase.",1
"I purchased 4 items and they were all so cute, exactly what I was expecting for minimalist jewelry!",1

Additionally this seller is so easy to work with, the seller quickly helped me with a specific request on my order, with no trouble.

I have, and will, be a repeat customer.",1

"The quality and versatile style is worth waiting for! My husband noticed them right away and complimented on there elegance.  At first I worried about if they would be heavy and if they would pull on my ear, but they are the perfect weight.  I love them!",1
"Just wow. This is my second purchase from OtisJaxon and the quality and pieces are just gorgeous. I  have finally found classic earrings that aren't boring. As my partner put it: they are my ideal style: simple, classic, and complex in one design.",1

"Nicely made, delicate sterling silver earrings with tiny sparkly zircons.  Just the right thing for affordable holiday bling!",1
"Shipped SO fast! I was worried since I tend to have sensitivity towards earrings, but the gold plating is nice quality. I can wear these comfortably all day! They match my rainbow sapphire pieces perfectly... no one can tell that they are CZ! :) Great size, and they stay on the lobe securely. I am very happy with the quality, and especially how affordable they are.",1
This seller is awesome!  I ordered a few gifts and the quality is amazing. My daughters loved their anklets!! And super fast delivery!,1
It WAS a pretty bracelet with the colour of coral beads subtly and beautifully varied. But unfortunately what I received had the knot visible and it took my 5-year-old only a few hours to break..,1
Received these and I'm so happy!  They are just as beautiful as the pictures made them seem!  So we'll made and I am so excited to wear them!  Love them!,1
"These earrings are exactly what I was looking for! So dainty, but something a bit different. I can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! I would definitely recommend these. Really well made and fabulous customer service.",1
Absolutely beautiful!!,1
"Gorgeous, unique, and so comfortable. I wore them all day and forgot they were there.",1
"The earrings I bought are so beautifully made. I didn't realize when I ordered them (for a college graduation gift) that the beads on the curve are free to side along the circle, which is a nice feature. Delivery was fast.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
"I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm wearing earrings they‚Äôre weightless.  I was worried at first because the posts were kind of short and I have fat ears but they‚Äôre perfect, it adds to what makes them sooooo comfortable! Not to mention how beautiful they are! This is one talented lady! I already want another pair ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
I've had these earrings for a little over two months now and they are so nice! I wear them almost daily. They are delicate but sturdy. The gold and blue bead combo looks great and goes with pretty much everything I wear. Thank you for exceeding my expectations.,1

Beautiful! I will be ordering a pair for myself. My neice is going to love them.,1
"Abigail is very friendly and responsive making her easy to work with. I ordered the skull stud earrings and am pleased with them. They are a good size for studs, not too big or small. These skulls are delicate in appearance and strangely classy for skulls. The stone in the skulls eyes is very tiny but pretty when it catches the light. The purchase was worth the wait.",1
"Beyond worth every penny. Searched all over the internet for something exactly like these and this was the only place I found a dainty, high quality, affordable and white gold skull earring. I most definitely recommend and will be purchasing more from this shop!!",1
These arrived really fast!  And they are absolutely perfect!!  Thank you so much - I love them!,1

Excellent seller! Great communication and great customer service! Ear cuff is very good quality and exactly as pictured,1
It‚Äôs very cute and dainty !,1
"The earrings are beautiful and feel sturdy enough for daily wear. They are a smidgeon smaller than I anticipated (they're not easily visible on my chubby earlobe), but they are wonderful and comfortable. 

Also, the shipping was super fast, the package was smartly and safely packed, and arrived in perfect condition.",1
These are dainty which is what I was looking for. I love big bold earrings but my bestie's twins will wreak havoc on my ears with them. So I had to look for baby safe earrings that were still bold. Fast shipping and the packaging was minimal but beautiful.,1
"So at first I absolutely hated these because my earlobes are definitely too fat for them üòÇ
A little tweaking later and I am in love with them! So cute and perfect for my small (but fat) ears.",1
"I actually ordered these for myself as a gift after my furbaby crossed the rainbow bridge. They are so delicate and beautiful. They look like they'd cost much,  much more than they do. I'm absolutely in love!",1
This earing is so beautiful! I am so glad I bought it. It's beautiful and very well made. I love that it's not a stud so it doesn't hurt at all. I love love love this earing!,1

"I bought the silver version, it is a nice size and has pretty detail. Easy to adjust and stays in place. Shipped out on time but be aware that with the usps it can take a while to arrive. Worth the wait for me!",1
This was a gift for my mum and she is delighted with it. She says the colours are rich and very pretty and it matches her dining room decor! She also loved the personalised message.,1
They are beautiful and IÔ∏è get a lot of compliments,1
Good style and the description of product it's the same,1
Great communication. Amazing quality items. I order some stars and they are so unique! I‚Äôm obsessed!,1

Love! Love! Love! My purchase üòÅ The earrings are beautifully made and look really elegant and stylish. Will definitely be ordering again.,1
"Thank you so much, I bought these for my wedding and can‚Äôt wait to wear them!  Great quality and I love the screw fit for the upper ear which makes the fit perfect and discreet, unlike other versions that use clips x",1
I absolutely love these earrings.  The quality and packaging is superb.  I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again!!!!!,1
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! i recieved so many compliments. Thank you so much for the quick process and shipping. I‚Äôll definitely will be buying again,1

They look lovely and are beautifully crafted. I have already gotten so many compliments on them!,1
"These are really pretty; delicate, but very sturdy and I love wearing the studs on their own as well! I was hesitant about ordering on Etsy for the first time but Virginia was very helpful and answered messages quickly. Really happy with my purchase!",1
Love them,1
This is a spectacular ring!  Beautifully made and the design is bold and eye-catching.  A real statement ring.  Super comfortable too!  We had delays in the shipping process (the times we live in!) but Rin was very responsive and accommodating.  I never had to worry.  I highly recommend this seller for beautiful quality jewelry and outstanding customer service.  Will be purchasing more.,1
"I got this as an engagement ring. It is so beautiful, and as mentioned in another comment, daintier then it appears. I barely notice it is there, which is what you want from a ring!  It was well worth the wait of shipping.",1
"I waited several weeks for this, but it was worth it. Solid, detailed cuff with comfort in mind.",1
Love these cute zebra studs. They are super lightweight and a great size.,1
Really pretty piece. I've recently become slightly obsessed with ear cuffs and this one is great!,1
I love it! Thank you!,1
This item is beautiful!! Great work and a fun new accessory!,1
"Very nice, good communication, pretty.",1
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead-  instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.,1
The ear cuff is beautiful! It's exactly as described and arrived on-time.,1
"All three items came nicely packaged, with a lovely note from Kivoto's wonderful people. The relationship I developed with Kivoto has been the best gift I could ever want. They made accommodations for my taste and we worked together splendidly. I am excited to have made their aquaintence ,and now I have new friends in Greece! 
Thank you so much for your kindness. I have taken the glitter you sent and adhered it to a very important book that I made, so I will never forget you! Blessings to you all!!",1

"This shop is wonderful and the jewelry is beautiful! 
I purchased 3 stacking rings as a gift, and they were perfect, even prettier then I expected. However, I accidentally ordered incorrectly, I reached out to the seller and she was very sweet and accommodating to my issue and we were able to come to a resolution that worked for both of us. The jewelry is amazing, the customer service is even better, I‚Äôm certain you‚Äôll love whatever you order! Shipping took a little longer then expected but that‚Äôs bc it‚Äôs handmade so totally understandable. I‚Äôll be a customer for life and highly recommend this shop.",1

I cannot wait to wear these on that special night out!",1
Love it so much! It is just like it is pictured and makes me feel so beautiful when I wear it! I jus wish they used a different type of earring holder than the cotton type as it came all tangled up in the mail. Love that they tied it with a ribbon though!,1
"Fabulous! They came in time and look just like in the pictures. They are not too heavy and, when I wore them to my sister's wedding, I got a ton of compliments on them!",1
"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING! Shipping and handling was great too. 

However, if you have small ears, such as myself, then these might prove to be a bit difficult to wear. It took me a while to get everything on, but it was totally worth the effort. Would highly recommend, even if you have smaller ears!",1
So happy with these! Gorgeous earrings arrived quickly and with a sweet note for my mom's birthday. The perfect balance between dressy and casual.,1

"Sweet and delicate!  These are just as pictured and arrived in a timely way with minimal packaging, which is a big plus in my book.  I treated myself to several ear climbers/crawlers and I wanted some new gold ones to go with some necklaces I have and these are perfect.  Nice and matte and good quality fashion jewelry that looks more expensive than it is.  Great price point and and I would definitely purchase from this shop again.",1
"I ordered these for my friend for her birthday. I decided I wanted a pair too. As soon as they came in the mail three days ago, I put mine in and haven't taken out since. A bit tricky to get in the earring holes, but once they're in and adjusted, they're super comfortable! I've gotten a bunch of compliments on them. I'm excited to give my friend hers tomorrow. She's going to love them!",1
"I've purchased from VermeilSupplies twice now and won't hesitate to come back. Super fast delivery and everything is high quality for a reasonable price. My purchases from a year ago are holding up well, no signs of tarnishing after a year of wear. Highly recommend.",1
"I love my dopamine earrings - I am a psychologist, so they are a great accessory for work. 

I had some difficulty receiving my order due to post office mix-ups. The seller was absolutely fantastic in dealing with these issues, even going so far as contacting the postal services in our respective countries and attempting to trace the package for me. In the end, he sent me a new order, no questions asked. I was extremely impressed with the service and would highly recommend this seller.",1
shipped fairly quick despite the chaos in the world and they were a bit smaller than what i expected but fit perfect!! never seen a pair of earrings like this I really like them!,1
"It was a little bit smaller than I expected. However, the quality was great!! I LOVE the design but it's not stable to wear it. That's why I gave the seller four stars. I think that it depends on your ear shape. 
I'll be back to purchase other earrings sometime soon. :)",1
Looks so delicate and interesting!,1
STUNNING! I LOVE YOUR STUFF! THANK YOU! I WILL RETURN!,1
I adore these earrings! I purchased the full moon and crescent moon sets so I could wear one in each ear if I want. Super unique and delicate looking- I will definitely purchase from this shop again :),1
"Love these studs and jackets! There are so versatile, you can wear the jackets with any stud, wear them in front of ear, the list goes on. Have several other pairs of Emerald's jackets and they too are awesome. Go get some!",1

"Absolutely beautiful necklace.  Ordered for a friend that just had her first baby.  I know she will love it.  Seller is very quick with message replies.  She even exchanged the baby feet charm for a birthstone charm per my request at no extra charge.  I ordered on June 1st.  It was shipped on June 2nd.  Received only two days later on June 4th, and that was with just standard shipping. 
 Fabulous all the way around.  Definitely recommend this seller.",1
"I recently lost 2 incredibly special kitties a week apart and I'm just heartbroken.  I was looking for something special to memorialize them.  I found a necklace with the message ""I'll hold you in my heart until I can hold you in Heaven"" and Rebecca added 2 hearts with my kitties' names on them.  I received the necklace today, and it exceeded my expectations.  I love having this remembrance necklace resting close to my heart.  It brings a small measure of comfort at this sad time.",1
"When I got the necklaces I really was impressed ,good quality beautiful, very satisfied thank you I‚Äôll definitely order from them againüëç",1

"I'm over the moon about these gorgeous studs, which are exactly as pictured: A simple yet interesting design that uses flattened silver with the wide part on the edge, overlapping ends, and finished with an antiquing wash. I love them. Due to COVID-19 shipping shutdowns, it took two months (to the day!) to receive them from Israel. But they are here safe and sound and in glad hands (or rather, on glad ears). Thank you, Vladis!",1

Love them I haven‚Äôt taken them off!!,1
"They're gorgeous! Heavier than I thought, but look high quality. I am a bit worried that the fastener will become loose over time, I would feel more at ease if it was a hook or sth, but time will tell. For now, super satisfied and I enjoy wearing them üòä",1

"The seller was helpful and definitely ensured my order arrived on time for a wedding! I was so surprised at how quick it reached me. The earrings were exactly as pictured. A very small con was that I expected the earring backing to be silver too for the price and not a silicone one. None the less, they fit and sit well :) will be back again!",1
"I love these jackets!! My piercing holes are bigger than the standard post, so I use my own posts that are of a bigger gage. I knew that when I bought them. They add an edgy unique look that you just can't find anywhere. THANK YOU!!ü§óü•∞",1
"I love these earrings! I wasn't sure about them at first, because I didn't think they would look good on me, but now I'm glad I took a chance. They're both minimalist and bold at the same time.",1

Shipped quickly,, packaged well. Best of all was the note and personal attention given. Thanks Fad√©la ""ClipAddict""!!!",1
"These are gorgeous!!!  Much better than the photos!  The contrast of blue and white is stunning. .. Although the size of the clip is smaller than others, and not secure, and slipped off,, quickly,,, resulting in getting lost.

Thanks Fad√©la ""ClipAddict"" !!!",1
The clips are really nice and individually made. That's why I love shopping here and the giveaway is really helpful. Many Thanks!,1
"New favorite earrings! My grandmother gifted me with ear crawlers/climbers as a graduation gift a few years ago and I‚Äôve been obsessed with them but I could never find an everyday pair and have been searching ever since. When I bought this pair, I was so overjoyed. And I was so surprise with how fast it shipped. Even though I just got them, I am OBSESSED! I love them so much already. Also, I have a difficult time shopping for earring since my ears are very sensitive, but these don‚Äôt irritate my skin at all.",1
"I‚Äôve seen these and wanted them for so long finally purchased them and there even more perfect in person , I‚Äôm still trying to figure out the climber part but I love love love them so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1

"Just Lovely!  These earrings are everything I look for in good quality sterling silver jewelry: beautiful, unique design; impeccable craftsmanship: discernible quality; great value for the price; and appropriate ‚Äúheft.‚Äù By that last one I mean that, unlike some of today‚Äôs hollowed out sterling, these feel and look solid and luxe. They make a statement with the design, but also are dainty. It‚Äôs also a solid investment because you get AT LEAST two pairs of earrings (posts alone, posts with the jacket.  The posts and jacket also can be combined with other elements I have in my jewelry collection for numerous additional looks.  Heading over to this shop to find more great items. 

To top it all off, the earrings arrived in just a few days... SO SPECIAL!

THANK YOU!",1
I think these earrings are very Nice! The Turquoise is Bright! Very nicely made. It's an added bonus that it can be worn with just the one Turquoise piece! I wore it in my second hole! Looks nice that way too!,1
"I‚Äôm so happy with how my earrings fit, they are such a fun little pair. I can wear them as studs, or with the back piece attached, either way I can see these a newfound favorite for my jewelry box. I have never seen this style of earrings before, it feels like they are that little bit of something extra special for daily wear. Highly recommend!",1
love these!  love that I can wear just the posts too.  2 in 1!,1
I wore this cuff for my wedding and Olga ensured it got to me with plenty of time to spare. People loved it!!,1
I‚Äôm so excited about this piece! Delivery was so fast and the details are exquisite. I also love the added detail of the stud earring. The seller was so easy to communicate with and gave me updates along the way. Can‚Äôt wait to wear this at my wedding! Thanks so much!,1
"I can‚Äôt begin to explain what a wonderful experience I had with Olga. I messaged her about a custom order based on the ear cuff she had in her shop that would compliment it. She was very prompt in her response and incredibly nice to work with. She asked me questions about what I was looking for and developed a design based on that, that was no less than perfect. She shipped really quickly, the packaging was beautiful and the cuffs were even more gorgeous in person. I highly recommend Olga for BEAUTIFUL, one of a kind pieces. She made me something that will make my wedding day even more special than it already will be.",1
Such a beautiful and unique piece for my wedding day! Little tricky to get on but I got the hang of it. Shipping took a long time but it was coming from Russia so was expected.,1

These are stunning! They came in a great little box and see gorgeous in person. I highly suggest for anyone looking to give great quality earrings at a great price! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"Lightweight, architectural and eye-catching. Love these and use the back portion with many of my post earrings.",1
"Full discloser:  I haven't worn them yet, so I don't feel that I can give a 5 star rating at this time. It hasn't quite been a month since I got my ears pierced. Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them.
I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful.",1
"Super cute, and I get lots of compliments when I wear them. They were excellent in communicating with me!!!",1

Beautiful earrings thank you,1
"I really love these earrings. The posts are thin which makes it easy to put them on. Sometimes they fall vertically, but I think I just have to figure out how to adjust the earring backing and post so they stay put. These are the perfect size and color. They are minimal and elegant. Delivery was so fast, too. Jut as beautiful as the photos. Exceptional experience.",1
The moon phase crawler earrings are beautiful! I get so many compliments on them and they‚Äôre very comfortable on the ears.,1
"The moonstones glow almost magically!  The phases of the moon üåô intrigue me still, and I‚Äôm so proud to wear my new earrings!  The craftsmanship is impeccable. üíï",1
"Les boucles d'oreille sont magnifiques!! La livraison a √©t√© tr√®s rapide.

"Very neatly designed and comfy to wear all day everyday! I love them, simple and classy!",1
Thank you for the beautiful earrings! I love them. The shipping was fast considering how far they had to go.,1
These are so amazing! I keep getting compliments everywhere I go! I was a little nervous about the metal since I have sensitive ears but I haven‚Äôt had any issues! I bought these in both colors. They are both super secure and pretty lightweight! The customer service was so great too! Get yourself a pair girl!,1
These earrings are amazing! One of the easiest pair to put on and the most compliments I've ever received! Nice weight to them as well. Would definitely recommend and I've directed a few to this page! I have to hide these from my mother ha ha maybe I'll have to get another pair for mother's day ü§î,1
"Item: I love the earrings, they are great! I will say they are a little bit flimsy so be careful when putting them on!

Shipping: Great! They were shipped on time and were in tack when they arrived.

Customer Service: Very polite and helpful!",1
"not as heavy as they look, super comfy! I've already gotten so many compliments on them",1
"LOVE! This climber is exactly what I was looking for -- delicate to look at, but sturdy enough that when I put it in I know it will stay in place. Will definitely order more from this store. Also appreciate the fast shipping!",1
Love thank You üôè,1
I wish I could give you more stars. I bought from this person multiple times and also recommended people to them.   I love your jewelry!!,1
"Worth the wait!  I can see myself wearing these every day.  Very simple, yet chic. Thank you so much!",1
LOVE them! I got all the women in my wedding party these earrings (and also got myself a pair!!). Very reasonably priced and beautiful.,1
"Love these bar earrings! I got them in several colors. great quality, even better price! =)",1
Decided to treat myself to new earrings during the pandemic and got about 6 pairs from this shop. Love them!,1
"Got them today, super-do, love them! they are very long. I might have gone with smaller ones, but I do love them.",1
These bands turned out amazing. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and had no wedding band because we couldn‚Äôt find exactly what we wanted and these we‚Äôre definitely it. The stones are blue diamond but my wedding ring is London blue topaz but they matched perfectly. The jeweler who made my engagement ring told us a small London blue topaz wouldn‚Äôt match my center stone because the size would alter the color so I‚Äôm glad we were able to find something that matched so well.,1
I have a blue diamond ring i wanted a band to go with it. Love the band. Perfect match. Would order from here again. Such great craftsmanship.,1
I had some custom bling made to add to my antique wedding ring and it turned out great :) They were very patient as we worked through the process and honest when I asked for input. It was made and shipped faster than promised. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase :),1
"Beautiful, dainty little ring.  Works perfectly in front of my 3 stack alexandrite and opal rings.",1
"Got these for me and my girls for the wedding, they are perfect! Got them in rose gold and silver and they are so pretty and light.",1
"Love these!! Shipped super fast and arrived safe & sound in a cute little bag. I got the rose gold ones colored ones, and they go great with the rest of my rose gold jewelry collection. Thank you!!",1
"These are the second pair of ear crawlers I have purchased. After the quality and comfort of the first I knew I wanted another pair. They are as beautiful in person. This seller has amazing things. If you‚Äôre considering buying, you should, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!",1
Delicate & beautiful! Shipped on time! My bridesmaids love them!,1
"These earrings are incredible quality. They are solid. I can feel how much love and intention was put into them. I used some small needle nose pliers to gently adjust them to my own ears, which was very easy to do, one small adjustment at a time until they were perfectly comfortable. I love them so much and have already received so many compliments on how unique and beautiful they are. Thank you!",1
Took exactly 6 weeks to receive these earrings but finally they arrived safely and I am loving them! Very comfortable- the posts are not too long so they do not poke behind the ear. They fit my lobe better in my second piercing- rather than the first- but that works just as well. I love anything new and different and these are certainly that! Thank you!,1
"My second pair of earrings from this shop, and I doubt it will be my last! I ALWAYS get compliments whenever I wear either pair. The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the shop owners communication. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!",1
"Love the weight and feel of these, as well as how secure the notched posts feel. The gold is very warm and shiny, making the snakiness very subtle, which I love. Now I want them in silver too!",1
She loved it (my science woman...) but I noticed that they have sides.... you have to put the left one on your let ear and so on.... That kinda sucks a bit..... :),1
interesting and novel.  Nothing more to add.,1
Bought as a replacement for one I lost as I love them sooo much. Beautiful item and really quick delivery. 100% recommend.,1
These are beautiful!  Thanks for the fast service! I'm looking forward to wearing them with all my earring studs.,1

I love this earrings! Got them in time and beautifully packed.,1
"The quality of the product as well as the customer service, were outstanding!",1
"Absolutely stunning! The cuff fits the entire edge of the ear perfectly. Fastening keeps it nice and tightly secured without making it painful or uncomfortable. I absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it on my wedding day. 
I also love the beautiful little box and pouch to keep it nice and safe. Thank you so much ‚ù§",1
"Beautiful jewelry, I initially ordered the ear climber which was stunning but when I tried it on with my dress it wasn‚Äôt quite what I was looking for. I contacted the shop to exchange it for a different pair of earrings, a few days later I received them and they were absolutely perfect! Affordable, yet expensive looking. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day, will post picks later :)",1
OMG! I used it for NYE party and I got sooooo many compliments for these statement earrings. They look amazing! Thankfully it arrived earlier than I expected and I'm so glad that I was able to wear it. Looks amazing with my dress. Just wow!,1
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. 
Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!",1
"Beautiful item! It took about a month to get here, but thats understandable with the corona virus and shipping across several different countries. It fits well, but is slightly painful to wear for long periods. Still in love with it though!",1
They are perfect. I love the option of studs or dangling. Thank you!,1
Very nice.  Will wear often. A bit smaller than expected..  Shipping was prompt.,1
"I purchased this as a gift for my mother's birthday. She loves amber and  has admired the ear jackets I've worn. This was a happy marriage of both. When she received these earrings, she absolutely LOVED them. She said they are very elegant and received many compliments on these beautiful pair of earrings. Thank you very much for making my Mom happy. ;-)",1
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞,1
"I ordered these for my wedding and they‚Äôre great! I have smaller ears so the longer style I‚Äôve seen wasn‚Äôt going to work. They‚Äôre a little tricky to get in at first, but once they‚Äôre in they look so cute!",1
These are my new favorite earrings! They‚Äôre soft and dainty.,1
The gold is a little more yellow than I expected but- they came super fast and they are really beautiful!,1
Purchased to wear this to my Yosemite wedding in California. I absolutely LOVE them. They are delicate and cute.,1
I loved the dresses received - absolutely perfect!,1
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!",1
I love this bracelett.The Onyx stones are very big and the bracelett is a cool eye-catcher!,1
"These are my FAVORITE earrings. They look exactly like a beautiful sunset. The colors pop and sparkle. Tiffany (the seller) picks the most incredible stones. The quality is sublime. They are light and stay perfectly in my ear. You will not find a better artist on Etsy! She is incredible. These earrings are one of kind. I bought two of them and while the sunset was the same, the colors were different in each. I get compliments on them non stop! If your looking for wearable art... this is the place!",1
"This looks like a magical Caribbean sunset on the boat. It is even prettier in person than in the pictures and I have not been able to use any climbers that I have bought previously but not only did these work with my flimsy earlobes, they included directions (how freakin' clever!?!) on how to use climbers in general. I LOVE THESE.",1
"Fantastic! Arrived lightening fast given that it was custom made!!!  What a stunning Artisan handcrafted design.  I was actually shopping for other items, when this piece caught my eye.  Especially since they were enveloping some of the most luscious of my favorite stones.  The workmanship is excellent and the unique design makes this a truly one of a kind.  Light and easy to wear.",1
"The ear climbers are gorgeous, and arrived sooner than expected. I'm so happy! Thank you so much!",1
OMG I LOVE IT. It‚Äôs sooo beautiful and elegant looking. The packaging was adorable and they even gave me a pair of beautiful earrings for free as a thank you! Will definitely be buying from this shop again!!,1
"I always get hesitant about buying jewelry online, but this shop owner is amazing. They sent my items right away and the earrings I bought looked amazing. I have super sensitive ears and these earrings have caused me no problems! I am in love with the earrings and the customer service, I will definitely be buying from them again!!",1
"The absolute perfect earring for a second or third hole! I have very sensitive ears and the 14k gold has been wonderful since I originally put them in over a week ago. Thank you for the perfect, dainty touch to my ears! Highly recommend supporting this shop and I will be back!",1
So shiny and eye catching! I have very sensitive ears and have been wearing these for a week now - haven‚Äôt bothered me at all! The gift pair of earrings included in the package are also beautiful and very much appreciated. Highly encourage everyone to support this great small business. ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
I LOVE them!,1

I also received a little thank you gift along with it that I absolutely love, totally made my day thank youü•∞ I will definitely order from this artist again someday.",1
This is a wonderful product!  Even though I was expecting more of a thinner crescent moon shape I am still very pleased with it. Depending on what type of lighting it catches the color changes. Also the customer service was top notch! I wanted to make an adjustment to the color of the wiring and Sasha-Lee was able to accommodate the change I wanted. I would definitely purchase this again and also highly recommend this shop. :),1
"Absolutely blown away with how high quality all of these candles, wax melts and gem stones are!!! Beyond pleased with my purchase. The shop owner took a lot of time to carefully package everything beautifully. And shipping was INCREDIBLY fast! In love with these scents!! Will purchase again, thank you!!",1
"Love the turquoise ear climber earrings! A lot smaller than I was expecting, but that's a good thing! I paid a little more for shipping to get them by a certain date and they were delivered very quickly.",1
Beautifully made- they look expensive (especially for the price) and they shipped fast! Only thing is I wish they were one stone longer! But I‚Äôm a happy camper and will be ordering again.,1
"Beautiful! Very good quality for a reasonable price.  The earrings are not too overpowering, and look very nice!  I am happy with my purchase.  The shipping was very quick and packaging was adorable.",1
"First earrings I‚Äôve owned like this‚ÄîI love them! The style, stone, and color are lovely. Hopeful for longevity.",1
Even better in person. Got them in silver. They are a gift. Can't wait to see them on my sister-in-law. They are gorgeous!!!! Almost wanted to keep them for myself.,1
The earrings are very pretty - nice design! My daughter loved them and I appreciate your great service and communication! Have a happy New Year!,1
"Beautiful earrings! Kalypso is the kindest seller I ever met on Etsy, she wrote me a little letter and gave me another pair of earrings as a gift because I was the first buyer of the year. So incredibly nice! Thank you! :)",1

They are a little tricky to get on but I LOVE them!  They are very well made and an awesome design!,1

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.",1

Unbelievably quick to arrive and they look great.,1

Although we didn't keep the earrings, I would certainly recommend Otis Jaxon. 5 stars for customer service.",1
Perfect item. Bought as a present. They loved them. I'll be back for more.,1

Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!,1
I love these earrings! The communication was quick and easy and I am very happy with my purchase.,1

"I got my beautiful things and I‚Äôm in love! Initially I bought the stacking cuff open bangle for myself and the matchsticks earrings as a gift for my girlfriend but, while the earrings were on its way, I‚Äôve realized that I really really love them and need to have them myself :))) The only thing, I didn‚Äôt guess the size of the bracelet right. Next time I will get at least medium size. Small is too small. And thank you Steamy Lab for a little extras ;) On my way for a larger bangle üòç",1
"Absolutely gorgeous! Extremely well made and so dainty and elegant. Also the packaging was very cute, felt like I was opening a gift. Seller included a sweet and awesome surprise gift as well, which will be the next pair I switch out to later on. Highly recommend! Thank you!",1
"These are really simple and beautiful earrings! I have pierced ears and did not experience any problem with them slipping off. I have really little ears too! I thought they might be too long and mess with the ear cuffs I wear everyday, but they actually sit beneath them and help comfortably hold the cuffs up higher in a more attractive position so it worked out perfectly! I have been all about ear climbers lately and these are a great addition to my growing collection!",1
"These are a totally different style for me, but I got engaged to a ‚Äòsky full of stars‚Äô and these just made me have ‚Äòfeels‚Äô.

This is a perfectly lovely pair of gold hoop earrings.  The design is very unusual and I've gotten many compliments.

Thank you!,1
Great quality lovely delicate ear climbers*****,1
hi Jasmin I very pleased with the ear climbers but I am a disappointed because every time I put them in my ears and then after 10 minutes the won't stay and come out maybe I am doing it wrong but I tried so many times..please advice tank you regards adriana x,1
"Absolutely beautiful! I have had so many compliments, I wear it all the time.",1

I love DakotaDesigns' druzy earring studs and these are just the perfect pair!  Love the color and sparkle!!,1
"Very disappointing. I was really looking forward to these! They are pretty and as pictured but they don't stay on your ears at all. I had a hard time wearing them. The cartilage clip is purely decorative and doesn't do anything to hold onto the ear so every time I've put these on, they just slide right off and stay attached only to the bottom pierced part.",0
I can‚Äôt believe how the jewelry looked in person the pictures do not do it justice I‚Äôm so happy,1
I absolutely LOVE these earrings! Sparkle with a little spunk!,1
These blew my expectations out of the water and looked amazing on my wedding day. I had so many compliments on them and you can‚Äôt beat that price for quality jewelry.,1
"Gorgeous earrings. I‚Äôm very happy with this present for my mom. The earrings arrived super fast and were Beautifully gift wrapped! I don‚Äôt want to unwrap them, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not posting a picture. But the earrings look just as amazing as on the provided pictures!",1
"Boucles d'oreilles de belle qualit√©, je suis ravie de mon achat. Elles correspondent exactement au descriptif. Ilona est tr√®s sympathique et r√©pond rapidement aux questions. Elle √† mis tout en ≈ìuvre pour que je re√ßois mes bijoux en temps et en heures! Merci encore √† elle!",1
"Love these earrings so much! It's like 2 pairs in one. If you just want to wear the studs, fine. If you want to add the larger, hollow triangles, excellent! I've found that I can even wear the larger ones in two different locations too (thread the stud post through the tiny hole OR through the triangle itself). Aaaand sometimes I even add the hollow triangles to totally different studs. So love the mix n' match capabilities!",1
"I absolutely love these earrings. Seriously I get compliments a few times a week on the triangle ones. 

I love an active lifestyle and these are perfect to give me an edge look and style. 

I initially wanted the stick ones and bought the triangles on a whim. I haven‚Äôt taken them off!

Love that I was able to shop local and will definitely be ordering more from this shop ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
Funky and unusual. I get a lot of positive comments when I wear these. Great to mix and match the jackets too.,1
"I love these earrings. So different and cute. They are very versatile, I can wear them with anything. You have to be careful though if you wear a shoulder bag or scarf. I got them caught a couple times when taking my scarf off or my shoulder bag going over my head.",1
These earrings are beautiful and came exactly as pictured! I am very happy with them. Seller was great and communicated with me about my shipment as needed. :),1
"Really great earrings, took a little while to get to me, but worth the wait!",1
Very pretty and unique. I get a lot of compliments. Shipping took a while... each pair comes inside a cute little bottle.,1
Great item!  Came nicely packaged and with a polishing cloth!  Love these earrings!,1
"Very, very pretty and worth the wait (6 weeks from order to delivery to Florida). Wish it came in 20 gauge because 18 gauge was hard to insert in my earlobes. I do understand that 18g makes for a sturdier piece. Nice!",1
"I bought this as a gift, and it the receiver loves it! They look awesome and fit comfortably. Also, I ordered late and wasn't expecting to receive it in time for Christmas, but it arrived on time! That was an unexpected and completely awesome surprise. I will definitely purchase again from this shop, thank you so much!",1
Super cute! Lots of compliments love them!,1
Love them! I get so many compliments!  One was damaged originally but they sent a replacement very quickly!,1

Beautiful pieces and very well made! I get so many compliments on my ear pieces!,1

"Just got delivered today and I can‚Äôt get over how cute it is! Looks even better when on, can‚Äôt wait to wear it with a cute pair of earrings. Wish it came as a pair instead for just one ear, but I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It also came with a discount code for my next buy! ÔºàÔºæœâÔºæÔºâ",1
"Couldn‚Äôt be happier about my purchase! These are the cutest pair of earrings, and I got them when they were on sale so the price was great! They look even better when on, just couldn‚Äôt get a good picture.",1
"If you think this earring piece looks cute in the photos, just wait until you see it in person!!! The quality is amazing and the earring is sooooo pretty! I was worried about the cuff being a little tight but that fits perfect as well. The item was delivered fast and came in a cute little box - earring had no damages ^^. I fully recommend buying this!!",1

Beautiful ear climbers. Shipped fast with care in very nice packaging.,1
"I LOVE THESE!  These are the perfect ""leave them in and rock fabulous"" earrings.  Super comfortable, (you can sleep in these no problem) and adorable in style.  I'm so in love with these I'm saving up money for a second set, I'd be heartbroken if I ever lost these, or better yet get these in gold too.  I'd be set for life!",1
I fell in love with these earrings when i saw them and I love them even more on my ears.  They are unique and absolutely adorable.  And the backing of the earrings are so cool!  I just wish they were a little more secure as they have slid of a couple of times since I have worn them in the last several hours.,1
"These are so magical. Again, extremely well made and so magical looking. These do take a bit of adjusting on the ear, but that's more my ear's fault and than the earring, haha. So so happy with these. Delivery was very good too. Arrived sooner than expected and so worth the wait! Thank you!!",1
"these earrings are even better in real life than on the photos! beautifully crafted, good quality. and you can't beat the price :) thank you arajera for making my dream (of this type of design which is hard to find) come true!",1
"I adore these earrings!!! They are officially my favorite earrings. They are more comfortable than I originally thought they would be. The shipping was fast. Also, the packaging is adorable. The little glass vials they come in are super cute!",1
I love the different shades of pink.  Adds a great pop of color to your outfit.,1
really lovely earrings thank you,1
"Love love love these! I get so many compliments when I wear them (one big dipper, one Cassiopeia) and the climbers are really comfortable too!",1
"My brother's girlfriend loved these!  Took some finagling to get them in, but they looked great.  The posts on these are quite thick, so don't force them if you have small holes; you'll have to work up to them slowly with thicker gauge posts.",1
"Even though it took a while for the package to arrive, I absolutely am in love with these ear pins so it was well worth the wait! I have small ears and these still fit me pretty well!",1
"The shipping time seemed reasonable for it coming from the Phillipines to Illinois. In fact it still says its in transit but I received it by the end of April. I love the earring though! I've gotten so many compliments, people definitely notice these earrings :) Thank you for your quality work!",1
"So cute! Amazing quality, I love these ear crawlers. Will definitely buy more.",1
"I love my paw print ear pins !  I love that they came shipped in a small bottle with cork stopper - not only kept them safe in travel, but like a prize in a bottle across the ocean!  :)",1
"It‚Äôs pretty, love it. 
Thank you so much!!!",1
I had these earrings before and I really loved them but I broke one so I was so pleased to be able to get them again. They arrived really quickly in beautiful packaging and I really recommend this seller,1
"Took a while to get here, but was well worth the wait, love the details",1

Looks beautiful and exactly as it was pictured on the listing. They're perfect! Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  Customer service was quick and polite. Thanks so much!,1
Absolutely beautiful! Love these earings!!,1
"Beautiful piece and a friendly, helpful seller; would purchase again from this shop.  Be aware that the wire is significantly thicker than a normal earring stud; I had trouble getting my purchases IN my ear at first, but found a little massage oil to help immensely.",1
"I've always been a big fan of ear pins, but had a hard time finding something I liked and could wear all the time. The packaging was also really cute! Thanks! :)",1
These earrings are cute and arrived nicely packaged in tiny glass bottles.  perfect for gifting.  i get lots of compliments on them and the delivery time was fast.,1
I've received so many compliments on these earrings! They stay on well and I didn't need to adjust them at all. They're my new favorite pair!,1
"I really like the style however, its really small even for my small ears. Backing needs to be a little more secure. I lost one without even feeling it drop, fortunately found it later. Takes over a month to receive...which is long in comparison to another order I placed.",1
The red is so vibrant.  They look great on the ears.  Will definitely buy more.,1
"These earrings are absolutely WONDERFUL.  The look fantastic, stay in place without pinching, and are very lightweight.  They are well worth the wait.  I will definitely be purchasing again from this vendor.",1
"These are adorable!  Excellent service, and they arrived in a very cute little glass bottle with a cork!  Best packaging I've ever seen. I liked the attention to detail.",1
"I had ordered the same pair of earrings a few years ago but lost it on a vacation. So I had to get another one because I just love it so much <3 although the delivery time took longer than expected due to Corona, I'm still satisfied with it! Thanks so much :)",1
"These are absolutely stunning earrings and I couldnt be happier with them!! I've always had issues with cheap earring irritating my ears and I don't have that problem with these. They really accent the new piercings I just got, a must have for anyone who wants more jewelry for their ears without getting pierced!!",1
It is my first time shopping on Etsy and I am surprised by the good quality.  It looks so pretty on my ears. It is not bulky and so comfortable. It goes so well with my floral print dress. I definitely recommend it to my friends! Absolutely love it!!!,1
It is absolutely gorgeous! It's super comfy and not heavy at all. It shines beautifully in the light and are hands down my new favourite earrings!,1
"I love the earring very much! They‚Äôre super cute! The delivery was a little rough, I revived it a month after ordering it. However, I contacted the seller and they were very kind about it! Personally, my ears are a little sensitive to non-precious metals, so if you‚Äôre like me, then they might hurt to wear for extended periods of time. Good buy, though!",1
They're super gorgeous! I love them so much!,1
Love these earrings. Good quality.,1
"They're unique and lovely. Fits perfectly with small ears. 
It took 20 days to arrive to Spain. Thank you!",1
These are a joy to ware...I'm getting another pair soon!!!,1
Very pretty but hurts my ears :( sterling silver is usually gentle so I wonder if these are really silver. Shipping takes a while too but it's noted in the shop description.,1
Very very nice will made and came in a little jar that was a cute added touch.,1
So beautiful!  And they arrived according to the maker‚Äôs timeline for making and shipping.  Thanks again!,1
"This is a gift from myself to myself for my 36th birthday hihi  Made my order in the end of February and I have received it on International¬†Women's Day so it means even more now as a present!!! I am really happy with this beautiful lynx constellation earring ü§©
The product is gorgeous and comfortable to wear! I will definitely purchase again!
Thank you so much!!! üôèüëåüå†",1
"Thank you for my new favourite earrings! I've been wearing them every day since I got them. I was worried at first they wouldn't fit my ear but they're actually perfect. The temptation to just sleep with them is very strong, I must admit.
The little bottle they come with is really cute and is one of the many reasons these earrings would be perfect as a present. The shipping was a lot faster than I expected, too. 
So, I'm very happy on all fronts and I will definitely buy again from your shop. :D",1
Gotten lots of compliments on these! Love them!!,1
"My 19 year old sister-in-law loved these!  Took some finagling to get them in, but they looked great.  The posts on these are quite thick, so don't force them if you have small holes; you'll have to work up to them slowly with thicker gauge posts.",1
"Perfect item, nice fit, very cute package, nice seller, good shipping. Plus silver quality is very nice, didn't trigger my allergies to cheap materials. Really happy üòä!",1
This is a beautifully crafted product!!  They‚Äôre so Unique!!  I Love them!!  I‚Äôll definitely purchase from again in the future!,1
"Wonderful little earrings!  They are well crafted and fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying other styles, I get way too many complements not to!",1
"Great ear climbers, not the same cookie cutter look as so many - the design is wonderful!",1
I love these ear climbers! They are a great quality product and the maker put a nice touch on the delivery! I'll definitely order again from this shop! Thank you!,1
Love them!! Very unusual design- took me a little while to get the hang of putting them on properly (I've only got small ear lobes?!!) need to open them slightly & then squeeze them into place to keep them secure. I am really pleased with them though. Shipped as expected.,1
"The earpins are so beautiful and pretty easy to put on. Very reasonable price for a pair. However, the item took a lot of time to arrive and the tracking wasn't updated, seller was hard to reach as well. Very cute packaging. If it weren't for the slow shipping and the difficulty to reach the seller, this would've gotten five stars.",1
These are the cutest earrings ever. They took a month to get here but they are very much worth the wait! Thank you! :D,1
They are as pictured and very pretty but were a gift and took weeks to arrive. I understand that's the way with international shipping though! Oh well!,1
This is my second pair of climbers and a little dressier than the first pair I purchased which I love.  I wore them first for Easter Sunday and they were subtle and dressy at the same time. Definitely my style! I am very pleased with them. And Have received a number of nice comments about them from friends.,1
Nice earclimbers that feel sturdy! The gemstones sparkle brightly and sits nice and comfy on the ear!,1
Love it! These are my 3rd pair of Lucky 9s and absolutely gorgeous.,1
I love it. They are orginal and really gorgeous. Good quality also.,1

Lovely earrings & quick shipping to Canada! Will buy from again!,1
These are AMAZING! Thank you!,1
Yes i hav√© satisfaction m,1
These ear climbers are adorable. Everything came exactly as the seller had described. I ordered another pair of climbers and they each came in an adorable little jar. The seller even included a polishing cloth. Thank you!,1
Gorgeous! Really pretty and I loved that the pieces arrived in tiny little glass bottles!,1
"it took a little while to get here, but I've received several compliments on these fun earrings.",1
Very pleased with these earrings.,1
"Beautiful earrings.  Absolutely love them.  They are so cute and I have received so many compliments after only wearing them twice!  I did have an issue with the material used, my ears are very sensitive.  I covered the post in clear nail polish and this has resolved the issue and allows me to wear them in comfort!",1
These little elephants are the cutest! My sorority's symbol is an elephant so I had to have them!,1
"Loved these earrings and the cute little glass jar they come in! Really nice, quick delivery and friendly seller too. Thank you!",1
"I received my Three Elephants Sterling Silver Ear Cuffs on May 4th.  I got them just in time for Mexican/American Mother's Day.  I got them as a gift for a co-worker who loves to collect elephants.  She says that they are good luck, especially if they are given to you as a gift.  She was really happy with the results.  They are ""Super-Cute""!  I definately will be buying more ear pins/cuffs in the future,  How about my Ying and Yang suggestion?",1
Perfect!  I love my pins.,1

These earrings are beautufully designed and fit the ear perfectly. I received them within a reasonable amount of time considering how distant the maker lives is from me.,1
Lovely!!! Beyond my expectation.. Thank you!!!,1
Beautiful earrings.  Unique and gorgeous.  Packaging is super and a really wonderful surprise.,1
Beautiful and delicate. Perfect x quick too.,1
Cannot use these on my ears.  They do not stay up.,1
Beautiful! Ordered these as a birthday gift for a coworker who really liked my moon phase climbers. Took about a month to arrive in CA. Thank you so much!,1

The necklace I ordered is so beautiful! :-) I really appreciate that it shipped the same day & love that it included a handwritten note.,1

This was my first order and I was so excited to order different earrings I got a Z for my baby dog Zeek and a heart ‚ù§Ô∏è It came beautifully packaged and I LOVE ordering different earrings now having to get a set of two is so awesome! Love this company already ordered again within a week!!,1
"The simple, elongated figure of this silver ear cuff makes me think of modernist Alberto Giacometti. It's such an elegantly light statement piece that I purchased another for the opposite ear. Great work, Kostas!",1
I love it!!,1
Great ear climber. Modern and fun. Excellent quality. Ty so much,1
I love the ear cuff. It‚Äôs comfortable and is easy to wear.no problems with this shop,1

"the sterling silver was not as refined as expected but still good for a handmade item. love its design, it makes me look like im wearing 3 piercings.  shipping was fast. just had trouble with the local postal system in uae.

i recommend wearing the left one on the right ear and vice versa so you dont need to constantly fix it",1
Fast shipping and the earring are beautiful!  Thank you so much!,1

"They are so cute! Super simple, great statement piece. They bend easily so be careful. I have sensitive ears and they don‚Äôt irritate at all! Would recommend them to anyone! The packaging is also really nice, so if they‚Äôre a gift, the packaging is already great for that",1
"Beautiful climbers, very well made, fast shipping, thank you!",1
Beautiful earrings! They‚Äôre exactly as described. I love them already :),1
"Love these earrings! FYI to future buyers, these earrings are 3 pieces, not 2. You have the front and back like a regular earring but the jacket is a separate piece that you have to put on individually and then put the back on top of it. I struggled slightly to get them on, but once I did, I love them and wear them everyday!",1
"Really pretty! They were a bit too long for me, so they didn't look as delicate as in the pictures. But I have small earlobes, so that's on me. Great quality and fast shipping!",1
These earrings are gorgeous.  They do hang slightly lower than I thought from the picture but overall aesthetic is the same. I'd highly recommend.,1
"These little gems have a big presence, plenty of color and fire, set in a gorgeous, unique silver setting!",1
Use this for a cartilage piercing and I love it. Have gotten a lot of compliments. Shipped fast! Thank you!,1
So pretty and look so cute!! Love these so much!,1
Love this! Really stands out and is comfortable on my ears.,1
Material isn't good quality can't even keep the earring on my earlobes know matter how tight I make it. One star because it looks nice,0
"I love how it fits to my ear, they feel like I don't have anything on. And love how they look on me too! Shipping took about a month though, but I don't mind! :)",1
Love my gold climber earrings! I've already had a ton of compliments-- well worth the wait!,1
"Very pretty, easy to put in and they stay.  I have small ears and they're just the right size and the ""hammered"" gold shows up nicely.",1
Love love love these! Cannot even tell I have them in. They sit firm on the ear and don‚Äôt love around but in no way are too tight.,1
I luv it,1
"Love my name earrings, well made, fast shipping. Will buy again soon.",1

Just got mine yesterday and I love them. They're truly beautiful and I love the packaging. They came in a small bottle with corkscrew. Super cute detail that adds to the whole experience. Will buy from here again,1
Love the way these ear pins look on!!  The only negative is they slip down from the curve of my ear from time to time.,1
Beautiful earrings--fit well!,1
"I wore these for the first time yesterday, and got so many compliments on them!  They are super comfortable, and pretty and edgy at the same time.  Thanks for a lovely item!",1

"I like how you can choose the size of the ear climber. Love the Gold! So comfortable, forget they are in my ears. Would be helpful to include a little ""how to wear"" in the box though.",1
"Super cute, nicely packaged! The seller was also very courteous.",1
"Thank you very much.

Very beautiful‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",1
Love this item! So cute! Get so many compliments on them.,1
I have had so many compliments on these earrings! Great product and just what I was looking for!,1
Really beautiful set; I got multiple compliment on the ear climber specially.,1
For my daughters birthday in August. She loved them!,1
"Prettier in person, so lovely for a stone that isn't that lovely!!! Great items!!!! A+++",1
I love it!! Thank you..,1

I absolutely adored these! I bought these as a gift and they are so gorgeous! Wanting a pair for myself!  Plus the little package it came in was so cute!,1
Such a beautiful piece and Jennifer is a wonderful and kind seller!,1
"Fast Delivery, exactly as pictured, they're gorgeous earrings!",1
This piece is stunning! It is easy to put on and very comfortable to wear. It stays in place and does not require any adjustments once it's on. I receive so many compliments when I wear this ear climber! Tina customized my order and was lovely to converse with :),1
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day.",1
Exactly the same as on the photo. Beautiful item. I love it. Excellent contact with Eldor Tina Jewelry. I recommend it very much.,1
Gorgeous and classy. Love this!,1
Amazing quality!! Love the look. Not too over the top and but definitely hoops you can wear with any outfit dressy or just hanging out!,1
"My lovely earrings arrived  and I have worn them every day since! I am extremely happy with them, but also with your great service. I have my eye on another piece of jewelry! I highly recommend this shop.",1
"I've been looking for this kind of earrings for a while. I'm so happy I found these!!!  I absolutely love them! High quality, easy to put on (I wear them daily), fast delivery and an overall great experience. I will buy again from this shop.",1
"These are gorgeous!
I'm so glad I bought myself a little something while shopping for others.  I was feeling guilty about it but not anymore! So well worth every penny! Thank you!",1
Super cute,1
Love these! Great quality.,1
"These are BEAUTIFUL! Aquamarine is so hard to find just right, these are beautiful!! Even the stones are a little different (the middle one is more green), but the set matches and they are GORGEOUS!",1
"I took my time writing this review to thoroughly test these earrings. I admit I was disappointed these had the looped pin style attachment as I have not had success with those in the past. They are always too loose or not secure enough and the weight of the earring will cause it to continuously fall throughout the day. These earrings, however, are designed flawlessly where the pin back is curved and follows the contours of your ear and stays perfectly in place. They are both comfortable and fully functional, where you dont have to pinch the metal to your ears to get them to stay up. Also the stones are gorgeous and have a lovely clarity and luxurious, high quality shape.

Overall, I absolutely recommend these and I am going to check out more of their jewelry as I am very impressed.",1
Really beautiful stones and very well made. Arrived within a month as expected. Highly recommended!,1
I love these ear climbers.,1
Really awesome! I thought I was only getting one with my purchase but got two and I only have my one ear pierced so I got both on one ear and love it!,1
These look great!,1
These are so cool I love them.,1
"These earrings are so cute, but they didn't work for me. The black coating was coming off within a couple weeks, and once the interior was exposed I had a reaction in one ear. That earring was a different color -shiny brownish- under the black coating, but not all the way to the core. I worked with the seller to try to figure out what it might be, but we didn't come to a definitive answer. Still, she was very kind, helpful, and offered a refund. Great customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this shop again, although I might stick to solid metal rather than plated options.",1
Shipping took a bit but that‚Äôs understandable as it‚Äôs far away! I loved the earrings! They stay put and they are so cute!! So many compliments!,1
"These ear climbers are adorable! Takes a little time to figure out how to get them in your ear and situated correctly, but once they are in they seem to hold well and look great. I have very small ears and didn't want something too large and these are the perfect size. Also, the items came so nicely packaged in their own boxes and with jewelry cleaning cloths. Always a really nice touch, would definitely buy from this shop again!",1
I received this from the seller and it was packed beautifully.  I love this set. It is so versatile to wear in any combination that you like.  Delicate and subtle creating a special vibe.  I also got this in the silver finish!,1
I love them!!! They are gorgeous!,1
"I love these earrings! I had never seen this style of earring before. They are so cool and pretty the way they go up my earlobes. Looks almost like I have multiple piercings. It was a little tricky putting them on the first time, but easier with practice. I also loved that the earrings came packaged in a cute little corked glass bottle for storing them in so they won't tarnish easily.
Seller responded quickly to my questions, and the shipment got here pretty quickly considering they came from the Philippines. I will buy from this artist again.",1
"I love these, they look so beautiful and they fit nicely!  It took a bit for me to get them on since my piercing is a bit wonky - but that is just a me thing.  They did take longer than expected, but that was of no fault of the seller as she got them out by their expected time.",1
I love these! They are so cute! exactly what I expected and they shipped on time.,1
Received my order and they are everything I wanted. Love them so much!,1
Gorgeous. I love my new earrings,1
Very dainty and pretty. Won't overpower your outfit.,1
It's sooo lovely!  Highly recommended.,1
The pins are absolutely adorable! It does take a little bit to get to the US from Singapore - but they are worth the wait!!,1
"Perfect, I love it! But it does take a long time to ship if you live in the US.",1
"Amazing customer service from this seller - we had a problem with shipping (which wasn't her fault!) and she was responsive and fast about fixing the problem.  The earrings are wonderful.  I was amazed, because I have a pretty bad nickel allergy, so I'm always a little wary of buying jewelry online, but these haven't effected me at all.  So comfortable and beautiful to wear :)",1
"Very pretty earring, shipping took longer then expected but worth the wait.",1
"Very pretty, very light. Good service from the supplier.",1
These are the perfect jacket for my diamond earrings! I just love them! Glad I made the purchase.,1

Love love love! Got so many compliments the first day I wore. I wish I had more money so I could buy them all.,1
"Adorable on! Love the little bottle they came in, great idea! Great seller all around A+!!!",1
"The first pair I received was missing most of the lines on the rainbows. The seller was very nice and agreed to send another pair. Unfortunately the replacement pair wasn't much better. They're still cute for the price, but the quality isn't great. The shape outlines are nice, but you might want to avoid designs with imprinted patterns.",1
Was stolen immediately by my colleague!!,1
Fits Perfect and it is so cute. I get compliments all the time. I already ordered more!!,1
Absolutely perfect! Totally surprised my daughter with this set on Valentine's day.  Super quick service and totally suits my daughter's funky style. A++++ quality and service!,1

This is my new fave pair of earrings for sure.,1
Super cute and very comfortable! Exactly what I wanted! Thanks!,1
Gorgeous earrings! Much nicer than pictures or expected! Fast shipping and packed well. THANK YOU!,1
Absolutely stunning!! Really high quality materials and definitely a lot sturdier than any ear climbers I've bought before. Will definitely be buying loads more colours!,1
"While the shipping took a while, the seller lets you know several times so you know what you're getting into. But the wait is worth it! These earrings are so beautiful and were exactly what I was looking for.",1
"Absolutely in love with my earrings, thank-you so much!!!",1

Shipped very quickly, too! Thank you so much, I'll definitely be back to shop with you again!üòç",1
I love these! They are the perfect minimalistic look!,1

Beautiful piece of jewelry! Would by something else from this vendor as well.,1
I love it! Thank you! Delivery will take some time but everything arrived intact in a cute tiny glass jar. My second order and its a gorgeous buy!,1
These are beautiful earrings. This is my 3rd pair of earrings from this vendor and they do excellent work. Highly recommend.,1
Wonderful! Looks fantastic on. Shipping takes about 4 weeks just like she says.,1
"Simply gorgeous, I feel like one of the Amazonian warriors from wonder-woman.",1
These are the perfect dainty accessory for any outfit! I absolutely love the look and fun shape of them . They‚Äôre really easy to take on and off as well and overall just feel super well made,1
"I love my new threader earrings! They are delicate and excellent quality. Style-wise, they are exactly what I wanted. Shipping was quick too!",1
"Maybe not the exact pair I would have picked out for myself, but they're still very beautiful! I've been wearing more stud earrings as longer earrings have been getting smushed and caught in my masks, I've worn these to work a few times and already got some compliments!",1
Super fast shipping. Excellent quality. my favorite shop for ear crawlers.,1
these are so cute and shipped faster than i expected!,1
Wonderful earrings. They remind me of lightening.,1
These are absolutely beautiful. I cannot wait to wear them on my wedding day! Super fast shipping too!,1

Everything went smoothly and according to the timeline provided. I appreciate the card with care instructions and doubly appreciate the small glass jar it came in! I will be buying from you again someday hopefully soon!,1
"Beautiful set! I wish I'd purchased multiples, in different colours. I bought the gold colour which is a little off-gold, doesn't pass for real gold. But that wasn't my plan, just a heads up I'd recommend being adventurous with the colour! Arrived super fast, too!",1
"These earrings are so pretty! They are slightly too big for my abnormally small ears, so the tip of the leaves sometimes digs into the top of my earlobes a bit, but they still fit and look great, and don't come off unintentionally. Bought them in bronze to match the mini ring in the same finish also from this shop-- perfect combo.",1
Impeccably made earrings! I love the color and the compliments. Shipping was surprisingly fast to the U.S. Thank you!!!,1
"I adore these ear climbers, will be ordering more very soon. Thank you, I love them!",1
"I love these earrings! They come just as pictured, and feel weightless. It's easy to forget you're wearing them because of how comfortable they are. Totally great!!",1
Adorable! So happy with it.,1
Very nice item! Good Seller!!,1
not exactly what I expected,0
"We are a shop based on Paraguay and absolutely love maya Valentino jewelry!! They have the best customer service and great quality!! 
Thank you üôèüèª",1
My sister loved the ear crawler,1
"SO beautiful!! My little sun and moon pendant is exactly as pictured if not better!! Maria and her husband are so nice! She answered all of my questions very promptly and she was just a dream to work with! If you're wondering, the item is stamped 585 on the sun side! It's very discreet and it doesn't interfere with the design at all!! The normal bail is 2.5mm but I asked for mine to be made bigger (3mm) so that it could fit my chain's 2.5 mm jump spring and it fits perfectly!!
I paid 43.47 pounds to import it to the UK. The item was shipped incredibly fast with DHL Express!
I love her jewellery so much! 
Thank you! :)",1
"To say I‚Äôm in love with my ring is an understatement. I am so incredibly happy with it, it was exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs small and dainty and the lettering isn‚Äôt too bold. It was the perfect birthday gift to myself and it means so much to me! The customer service and communication was great. Shipping was super fast from Greece. Thank you so much Maria! Beautiful work you do!",1
"This necklace is absolutely beautiful. Exactly what I wanted, so delicate and shiny I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it! I‚Äôm so glad I discovered this shop, truly unique and beautiful pieces. I wish I had ordered this in the 14k because I want to wear it always! It‚Äôs perfect, thankyou so much Maria x",1
"Came in nice packaging and even coming all the way to Canada took less than 2 weeks to arrive. Was really nice being able to track it all the way with DHL. Perfect size; I prefer more minimalist jewelry and I love that it‚Äôs small and subtle, but you can still tell what it is without being 3 inches from my chest. I love the way the light reflects off of it and I can‚Äôt stop looking at it!",1
"Love, Love, my geomtric earrings very stylish, I have received several compliments. Thank you! (*.*)",1
"I'm very excited for my beautiful earing,  Thank you so much Gilat for answering all my inquires and sending out the package so fast! I love my new earing and after i received tham i can say thay are high qulity. I really recommend this store!!",1
"My ring was finished and shipped out in under the stated time which was great because I was so excited to receive it. The shipping was also very quick, under four days to get to me in the United States. The ring was packed well and it comes in a beautiful and professional ring box and everything. The ring itself is absolutely gorgeous. Every part is flawless. The diamond shape is completely clear and immediately recognizable. The width of the band is perfect and the size was spot on too. It was polished up nice and shiny. I cannot say enough good things about my experience here. The owner is friendly and makes beautiful And creative pieces. Thank you so much! I am so happy with my ring.",1
"Gilat went above and beyond all of my wants, needs, and expectations with my custom ring! She is an incredible artist and designer who left nothing out when helping me make choices for my ring. It is stunning and I could not have asked for a better piece. Amazing sparkle and fit. Thank you so much Gilat! I will be enjoying this ring for years to come.",1
"Gilat designed and created this especially for me and I could not be more in love with it. She designed both my engagement ring and my wedding band, so I know if I need beautiful and unique jewelry, she is the only person I think of. Thank you, Gilat!!!",1
None of the stores here including Macy's have anything this unique and attractive. They are extremely well made and light and comfortable to wear. Beautiful earrings made by a fine artisan. Would definitely buy from Yael again.,1
Gorgeous earrings! I purchased these for my wedding and am very happy with the quality and the craftsmanship. The communication process was also excellent. :),1
"So quick to arrive, brought for my mother to wear to my wedding just the right length and the colour is prefect to go with her outfit very pretty and unique thank you for shipping so promptly x",1
"Beautiful, well made earrings! Very good communication from the seller - friendly and helpful.",1
Lovely little sparkle of peridot! The best part of this necklace is the chain doesn‚Äôt eat up my hair during the day! Item arrived fairly quickly! Would definitely recommend if you‚Äôve been interested in a necklace with a little sparkle of color like this.,1
"Necklace is very beautiful!!! 
Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!",1
I love these! They are beautiful and I can't wait to wear them for my wedding! Shipping was on time and even sooner than I expected! And I love that I got two extra clasps.,1
Absolutely gorgeous! Really love them!,1
Insanely gorgeous. Such great quality,1
in love with these climbing earrings! fast delivery too!,1
So I had a tiny little diamond stud that was almost too small to even wear. These jackets made them my favorite earrings! My husband got me the diamonds and they have been in a drawer for years.  Now they are my favorites.  Just adorable!,1
"Well made, solid, thick, and useful with a couple of pairs of studs that needed a little something extra. Very artful look. Fun packaging as well.",1
"I like these...it's such a good idea:)  I think the tiny studs work best...  I tried some of my larger studs in them and they made the charming, layered aspect seem heavy to me, and there doesn't feel like enough length of stud in the back to make them feel secure.   Still, they are fun and provide a creative way to wear stud earrings:)  Excellent seller and fast shipping!",1
"I spotted these a while ago whilst at a market on holiday in the Dr√¥me, the work Sophie had on display was fantastic and I shall continue to look out for her work and buy it well into the future, thank you, Sophie, you've made at least one person very happy this Christmas.

Good luck for the future and Merry Christmas",1
"Finally found my dream hoops! Perfect size and shape for everyday but also special occasions. High quality material, so definitely worth the price. Thank you <3",1
"‚ÄòTwas tired of replacing horseshoes after I inevitably lost the ends so I figured I‚Äôd switch it up ~ was a tad nervous on how the style would look on me but wowoww what a lovely septum ring! The sizing is perfect, it‚Äôs incredible lightweight/ comfortable & v high quality! + I usually struggle with rings that bend but this one was super easy and holds shape. Thank yous üåøü™±‚ú®",1
"I finally received my gold septum ring from MomoSara!! It looks just like the photo. It's so unique and perfect! I love it so much. Definitely worth the wait (2-3) weeks, and worth the purchase to support a small artisan making jewelry! Thank you Dana!!",1
"I bought 3 separate earrings from MomoSara and they are so unique and cool. I have several piercings in one ear and these will have a home in that ear for a very long time. Shipping was rather long, but with Covid I can't complain - well worth the wait!",1
"I love this earring and have received a few compliments on it! My ears are a bit different due to my ethnicity but the fit was no problem, and it looks uniform with the folds of my ear! Love that the backing is flush with the ear so I hardly ever notice it. It does shake off loose every now and again but I just slide it onto my cuff again and all is well. Packaging was lovely and delivery didn‚Äôt take very long! The only thing I would change is to make the post a bit shorter so the climber doesn‚Äôt come loose.",1
Beautiful minimalist ear climbers! High-quality craftsmanship and extremely comfortable to wear. Perfect for my helix piercing.,1
"I love my new earrings, beautiful yet simple design that is super comfy to wear. Will definitely buy from Muka Studio again :)",1

These were a Christmas present for my mom.  They have great presence.  Thank you.,1
I can't say enough about these climbers.  I'm completely obsessed with them!  I'm already scoping out my next pair!,1
"These beautiful earrings capture every color I live with on my tiny island in the Caribbean. The sea in all its blues, the sky in all its hues and the sand. They are elegant,  beautifully made and presented with charm and care and shipped professionally. I am thrilled and will be wearing them right by the sea tomorrow at lunch (on the beach). They will sparkle and so will I. I will be revisiting this shop.",1
"These ear climbers are so pretty, I love them!",1
Very pretty piece!  I will enjoy wearing this!,1
I absolutely love this pendant! I have a thing for hearts and this is so artistic. The first day I wore it a woman stopped me to comment on how lovely it is!,1
I received my silver spike earring jackets today and I love them! They are of beautifully crafted quality and my lobes fit perfectly in the hole furthest away from the spikes. Thank you so much for a great buying experience. I'll be back to buy more :),1
Love these earrings! Originally purchased to use as mix and match earring but are so beautiful as they are I will be wearing them together! They will fit different size ears beautifully since they are adjustable. Recieved the item pretty fast considering from Spain to US and was able to track shipment. Not having the same experience from a different store I ordered an earring from the same day also located in Spain. So I highly recommend this store!,1
"These earrings look just as featured -really cute and makes me look stylish and edgy! :) The packaging was really nice too- it's like you're getting a present! I took off a star bec since they're dainty, they're also kind of flimsy/thin.  If you're not careful when you take them off, they can bend and may eventually snap probably overtime.  Other than that, they're great!",1
Fast shipping to Australia. Great quality. Previously bought these in rose gold and loved them so much I needed them in silver :P  Love!,1
Picture doesn't do it justice! So beautiful! It's a little big on my pinky ring but I'm keeping it. Paula was very responsive in my messages to her. Can't wait to buy more!,1
So amazingly perfect! Had it in my cart for sooo long and I‚Äôm so happy I got one! My cousin and sister loved it too so I got one for each of them and we‚Äôre all obsessed!,1
"if you are still debating whether or not to get these amazing earrings, here's your sign: DO IT! I'm very picky when it comes to jewelries, they must look good, and not cheap. These are absolutely gorgeous. I wore them for my birthday and I received compliments left and right!",1
Very sweet seller and STUNNING jewellery. The photo does not do it justice. I‚Äôm totally in love with my ear climbers <3,1
Love!!,1
"Not only was this as beautiful as in the picture, it came so quickly.  I ordered to the US and explained I needed it in time for my husband's birthday.  It came right on time and he adored them as he's a huge fan of pin wheels.",1
Beautifully made! Get many compliments.,1

The picture that I took doesn‚Äôt even capture the true beauty of these earrings.  I will wear them everyday.  And there super comfy, I don‚Äôt really feel them at all.  Shipment was quick, and there was a lovely note included from the ‚Äúartist‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è.  Thank you for your creativity and gift for making such beautiful pieces.  I will return to this shop as it is my new favorite.",1
Climbers are usually too long for my ears but the shorter option you provide fits perfectly and are snug as a bug on my thick lobes! Love them!!!,1
"The earrings I ordered were for a gift and she loved them! I had a mix up with the shipping address and the owner was more then willing to go above and beyond to find the package and get it resent to the right place! I would, for sure, order again! Thank you so much!",1
These are beautiful and the shop was lovely to work with. There was a sweet personalized note and the ear climbers were beautifully packaged. I hope to shop here again!,1
Absolutely obsessed with this!! It's so so cute and well made! Shipping was super quick too! Thank you so much! ‚ô•Ô∏è,1
I love it so much I immediately ordered another one! Great length and shape with beautiful mottled detail.,1
This is such a lovely design. Very well made indeed and it is clear a lot of love and care went into it. My ears I have discovered are much smaller than I thought- the wave sits in the groove but it is so close the the edge of my ear haha,1
Wonderful! Great product and fast delivery! Seller went above and beyond with the personal touch! Will definitely shop from here again!,1
Received earrings quickly. Can style in different ways for those who have more than one piercing.,1

"I loved everything about this order, from the shipment package made out of fashion magazines to the fabric gift packaging!! It is great that they care about the environment. Now on to the ratings which are amazing! Great quality and perfect for my wedding day! Simple and elegant.",1
"I love, love, LOVE this earring! I was looking for something to enhance my helix pierced area, and this earring absolutely fits the bill. I would definitely recommend!",1
"Photos are exactly what arrived, love the earring for my cartilage piercing! It‚Äôs so hard to find cute earrings with my sensitive ears, and I am truly in love with this one. Would highly recommend!",1
"Amazing piece. I am absolutely in love with it. My helix piercing was done only few days ago, so I still have red ear and little pain. But it is still absolutely comfy, even with fresh piercing.
It is very subtle and classy.",1
This is exactly what I was looking for!!! It doesn't irritate my cartilage piercing like the other climbers that loop through the ear. Looks great. Now I need to buy the silver one too!,1
"Looks just as pretty and delicate as in the listing! I've worn it a few times and haven't noticed any problems so far, it's quite good value for the price I paid. Very happy with it!",1
These were my first pair of ear climbers and I'm so glad I got them.  They're very pretty and dainty but easy to put on.  The only time the fell was when I was on the phone and wasn't paying attention.  I love them and got compliments on them!,1
These were my first foray into ear climbers.  They were beautiful and dainty and perfect.  So much so that I just gave them to my 16 year old neice for Christmas.  She loved them!,1
"Speedy delivery with friendly compliments card from supplier.
Love the ear climbers which are very comfortable.   Have been searching for just the right pair for some time and these are just what I need.  Altogether enjoyable shopping experience.  Thank you!",1

"These are fantastic earrings!  Well made, even prettier than pictured and arrived on time. Thank you so much, I love  them:-)",1
"Very helpful shop owner. I fell in love with the leaf ear jackets, but I already owned some flower studs I could use them with. It was no problem ordering with jackets on their own from a custom listing.

The jackets arrived securely packed and look great. Lovely details and no imperfections. I was also pleased to discover that they are sturdier than expected. They're well soldered onto a butterfly back and the leafy branch is nice and sturdy. It could've easily been made thin and bendy, but that's not the case. I wouldn't abuse the thing, obviously, but I won't be afraid of anything snapping off from just putting it on and off my ear. There's clearly good craftsmanship behind these.

Really lovely and unique design on these ear jackets, so I'm very happy!",1
"I really love these earrings. I need long post studs and they are a wonderful alternative. Super comfortable to sleep in. They do take a while to put them in, but it‚Äôs so worth it! I highly recommend for anyone that has semi new piercings.",1
"The earrings are just as described! They bend a little so be careful not to screw up the shape of them, but if you do it‚Äôs really easy to fix. Also would recommend making sure you check how the size will look on you because the three inch ones go all the way down to my shoulders which I was a little surprised by. Super cute tho!",1
"Suuuper pretty earrings. A little bigger than I expected. The rods are a bit long though so I can't sleep with these earrings, they poke me too much. Also the earring rod isn't gold plated. Not sure what metal is, probably stainless steel.",1
"Beautiful earrings they are even more amazing in person, exactly what I needed.",1
I got the hens just the other day and I absolutely adore them! they even came with some nice candy :) it was a great experience and I definitely plan to shop here again,1
I bought these for my niece who plays the sax and is going into HS band...she is not a big jewelry wearer but she LOVED these...perfect surprise gift!,1
Great gift. He loved them!!,1
"The pin was great and exactly what I wanted.
Thanks",1
"Very happy with this! I don't like needles, but this looks very real. I even sleep with it (though it needs some getting used to). It looked a little big on my ear, but you can bend it to your liking without damaging it. So I'm very pleased!!",1
I love how uniques these earrings are and get compliments on them all the time!,1
"This journal is so beautiful!! It is very well made and the paper, the color and the tassel to the journal ... very refreshing and beautiful! I highly recommend this shop and will definitely come back for more beautiful items! :-D",1
GORGEOUS EARRINGS. So well made. Bought two more pairs :),1

They look especially fabulous with the earrings they came with AND several others I've purchased from this awesome shop. I LOVE this shop! Excellent quality and unique designs! Thank you!,1

The journey to finally have them in my hand was a bit hectic: first, the name of the location of the shop is misleading: the jewellery are actually made and sent from Israel. The cheapest way to send them to me was choosen which ended for the parcel to be lost somewhere in Asia. Luckily I contacted Tommy after a few weeks of patience: he immediately offered to send them back, for free, via UPS. 5 days later they were in my country, waiting for me at the custom. I had to pay an extra charge (keep that in mind depending on where you live), but finally they were mine. They look perfect on me, it was worth all the wait and the extra little tax üôèüèª",1

I saw this bracelet listed and knew it would be perfect! Trouble was, I also have a guy in my bridal party. I reached out to Livia and asked if there was any possible way that the male lion charm, which I saw listed as a ring, could be made into a bracelet to match the lionesses. She was quick to respond, and to my delight was able to fulfill my request! They all arrived quickly and I was delighted to see that they all were exactly as I had pictured them! My bridespeople all LOVE them! We wear them out now on all wedding-related errands and plan to wear them on the actual wedding day as well. Thanks again!!!",1
"Livia was very quick to respond to my messages and lovely too! I asked for the guitar pendant only, because I wanted to make a bracelet from leather strips and it turned out exactly how I've wanted. Livia was so sweet she even sent me a clasp and rings to be able to make my bracelet. The guitar is the perfect size and the textured version is even prettier than the one on the picture (in my opinion). Thank you, Livia!!",1

"I am absolutely obsessed with my new ear cuff!!! 
I received it a lot earlier than I thought and this was a great surprise. Kathy contacted me before sending the package and made sure that I received it as well on the expected delivery date. Great help for a rookie Etsy shopper like me.
The product is exactly the same as the one that you see in the photo (size,color). 
I would definitely trust Kathy again. Thank you!",1
"I love these earrings! They're just as pictured and have posts about 11mm long so they fit comfortably on my ears, I'm so glad I bought them!",1
Stunning!  Absolutely beautiful!  Merci!!!,1
"More beautiful in person and in excellent vintage condition. Colors are soft and vibrant at the same time.
Arrived quickly and safe.  Thrilled with this painting.",1
Lovely earrings.  Thanks a lot,1
This bracelet was perfect. It came in a lovely presented box with ribbon and frills. The piece itself looked just like the pictures. It was beautiful and a great gift for my girlfriend. I would rate the quality of work highly.,1
Overall great! Love the size of the stud because it covers my stretched hole from my  gauges.,1
Super cute! I loved the packaging and shipping was pretty quick considering I live pretty far from the shop haha. Definitely plan to buy from this shop again in the future!,1
This look exactly like the picture and fits my ears perfectly without being too tight and leaving them red. The first pair I got in were broke and the owner was super easy to work with and sent out a new pair right away that came in perfect!! I love these so much!,1
Birthday gift for my friend but she says it falls off a lot,1
"Thank you very much, the package was very careful, but above all they are beautiful and hold very well to the ears! I am very happy ‚ô•",1
Pretty,1
I love these. LOVE THEM. I don't want to wear anything else now. Adorable! And comfy!,1
Beautifully made. Looks store bought!,1
"Well made, great for everyday wear",1
"Excellent ear cuffs!  I got the ""clear"" earcuffs (which in this listing, is white with pink and purple reflections)  It was a little unexpected but I'm happy to say Gill offered to exchange them for ""clear white"".  He also updated the picture to show the pink purple reflections (the one showing all of the cuff/gemstone options) Even though the color was unexpected, it turned out to be gorgeous and that's why I ended up keeping them. I'm completely happy with my experience. I highly recommend this shop - you won't be disappointed!",1
Absolutely Gorgeous!!!,1
Beautiful piece. Exactly what my daughter wanted for prom.,1
"Amazing product, wife loved the design!",1
Perfect and exactly what I wanted!,1
These earrings are amazing! Beautifully made and great to wear.,1
Love love love them! I bought them in silver and gold!,1
"The earrings are beeaautiful! Thank you so much for your talent of creating such extraordinary pieces. Can‚Äôt emphasize enough how much I love the design.

The earring backs are rubber, which are kind of a disservice to the elegant piece. But I‚Äôll take the compromise for the 24K plating than lower quality plating. Cost, cost, cost.

I impart the warning to others to be mentally prepared of VERY delayed shipping during this health crisis. The shipping from Israel to NYC was A MONTH ‚Äî and there were many days where there were no shipping updates whatsoever (not seller‚Äôs fault; 75% delay due to Israel Post and 25% delay due to USPS). That said, her reliable communication helped my eager self to be patient.",1
"Minima Maxima came to Renegade Craft in Boston, so I had the opportunity to purchase these stunning earrings in person. They're little art pieces - and incredibly lightweight. I loved them so much that I purchased another pair on Etsy for my cousin. Arrived quickly and beautifully packaged, as well. The owners are down-to-earth and super sweet - support these fine folks!",1
"I have these in silver and bought them in gold for a friend.  I love the unique art deco design.  They look great from the front and back, my favorites!  Thanks MinMax peeps :D",1
Beautiful and excellent quality earrings! I wore them on my wedding day!,1
"I love them! So little and cute, perfect",1
Love these! Love the size and reasonable priced. Thankyou,1
"Cute earrings, but backings were bent up from shipping, and had to try and straighten out the back of earrings",1
"These earrings are SO light, you don't feel like you're even wearing anything.  You can also reverse the bottom piece to reveal a black side to change it up to a silver/black earring!  I love them!",1
These earrings look and feel amazing. They are lightweight and so cool!!,1
"Lightweight, beautiful earrings. I look forward to wearing them out (when I can go out again...).  :)",1
These are so lovely and lightweight! Can't wait to wear them on wedding day.,1
"Very cool earrings. I‚Äôve been eyeing them forever, and finally bought them. They‚Äôre a little bigger on my ears than I expected, but they‚Äôre cute.",1
"This is my second purchase from this shop and just like the first time, I am very satisfied. The earrings are true to the pictures and comfy to wear!",1
These are so cute ty,1

Lovely earrings.  My daughter has worn them every day sice Christmas!  Would highly recomnend.,1
Wonderful earrings and arrived sooner than expected! Thank you!,1
I ordered a pair of small matte silver ear rings. I spent a little more and waited a little longer (than Amazon) - it's worth the wait and money 10 times over! I love them and feel good supporting a small business. üíû,1
I had my earrings customized to the perfect size! I believe they are the smaller size that are available now. My go to earrings that are great for everyday which is exactly what I wanted.,1
Absolutely in love with these minimalist earrings. I bought a 2 pairs that I now wear together everyday. Was a little nervous at first since I have a nickel allergy but they‚Äôre seriously awesome.,1
Really love this unique earring for the top of my ear cartilage piercing. Gets a little more attention than a regular hoop and it's so lovely and blingy. Perfect...took a minute to get to me but well worth it.,1
"Bought this second time as the yellow gold option was not what I hoped. It's a beautiful gift for my bestie now! Looks exactly like the pictures but more sparkling and gorgeous. I know she's going to love it ‚ù§
Delivery as always is really fast and Tugba gives fantastic buying experience (discounts given) You can tell she really values her customers - highly recommend here üëçüëçüëç",1
Love it! Looks like frosted gold dangling on my ears and very comfortable ü•∞,1
"Bought this for my baby sister who always 'borrows' my jewelry... on permanent basis. She's now returned some of my stuff as she's been wearing this piece everyday ü§£ and reminds me that she loves me dearly üòÖ. Maybe if I buy her a few more stuff she'll give everything back ü§î?

Delivery was really fast too ‚ù§",1
Gorgeous and dramatic earrings - beautifully crafted and I loved the ability to customize and the stone color and stainless steel studs to accommodate sensitive ears. Can't wait to show them off,1
"Love these! I had messaged the seller, and I received a quick and concise answer. They shipped a day later than expected, but from being shipped from Greece to the United States, it arrived almost a week before expected. The quality is amazing. They fit the ear perfectly. They aren't too loose, nor too tight. They curve the ear just right. They color is beautiful. I received compliments on them the first day that I wore them.",1

Thanks so much,1
"I just got my earrings today and I love them!! Thank you very much Osnat, I am wearing them at my wedding they are perfect!! I will be looking through your stuff again and making another purchase!",1

Gorgeous earrings! I ordered three items from this shop and USPS lost my package. The seller was responsive and kind and reshipped my items very quickly!,1

just a beautiful blythe doll ....really good seller ...very helpful...doll arrived packaged well ...and in good time .....definitely recommend this seller ....,1
"Jewellery nicely made when it finally arrived but huge delay (even after allowing for COVID), lots of chasing and corners cut throughout left me frustrated and out of pocket. Grannies & Aunties will get Xmas presents 1 month late, some of their jewellery will be sent in whatever packaging I can find as not enough  supplied. Hope seller can address the issues I experienced during this long saga as the product itself is sweet.",1
Love it!! So cute and such good quality!,1
super!!!Genau wie auf den Bildern!!!Gerne wieder,1
"I love these simple, elegant earrings! Easy to make casual or dressy!",1
"The Climber looks nice, exactly like pictured..only if you have tiny ears like me, it does not stay in place well. Still thank you for the quick send!",1
"Love these minimalistic designed ear climbers. I purchased my first pair a year ago and have received many compliments on them. They are easy to get on and off and are perfect for an active lifestyle. I lost one and was able to purchase a replacement for the side I lost instead of a whole new pair which was really nice. While I was at it, I ordered a gold pair and am in love with those too!",1
They are so beautifully made and are gorgeous!! Thank you!,1
"Bought 2, one for me and one for a friend. They arrived quickly and we both love them! Very delicate and pretty. The size can be adjusted based on where you attach the clasp, which is good because we both have small wrists. Have gotten several compliments on this bracelet!",1
"I apsolutely adore them! Beautifly packed, gorgeously done. I am so happy to have them. Wonderful work and I strongly reccomend them!",1
"These are even prettier in person! I rarely see RQ merchandise, let alone jewelry, so I knew I had to snag one of these for sure when I saw Victoria Aveyard herself post it. I love the earrings!",1
"The seller was very commutative and created a beautiful piece of jewelry. For anyone who is a fan of the red queen series, this piece is perfect!",1
so beautiful! book accurate but subtle! i love it!,1
OBsessed with these! So many compliments and so well made. :),1
I got this to make for my mom for Mother's Day. I didn't realize it would be late... oops. But it was shipped within the time frame I was given. I JUST finished it. I received it today and finished it today. It's a relatively quick project. And is gorgeous. The video instructions were perfect as well. I am definitely going to be buying more! Thank you for these kits.,1
"Absolute winners, I'd never worn anything in this joint style before but I'm glad I decided to try it. The purchase process was smooth and efficient and the final product is beautiful and elegant.",1
Super dainty and cute! So far no irritations. Would recommend it for any jewelry loving person!,1
